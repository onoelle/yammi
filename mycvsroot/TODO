todo-list
---------

for next release
----------------
- delete dialog box
- touch history file on first startup
- prefs for second sound device
- submenu in context menu?

- check update view actions after changes to database
- better documentation
- show history of logfile


for future releases
-------------------
- more options for burning folder
- more options for keeping consistency

- fix: two albums having the same name appear as one album
- fix: doesn't show meaningful value for bitrate and length when variable bitrate
- fix: some mp3s appear as corrupted (layer information not readable?)
	

todo (later)
------------
- replace id3 tag handling (and mp3 layer info?) with something better
  (probably switching to id v2 tags, using a library)
- port to windows?
- more snappy interface
  (might be a bit slow with more than 2.000 songs and/or on a slow machine)
- more detailed logging + evaluation of log info
  - playing songs that haven't been played for quite a while
- take over playlist management from xmms? nah, probably not!
  (and only send song to xmms when last one almost finished)
- put it all into a proper database (upto 5000 songs I think it'll do as is)
