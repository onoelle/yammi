<H2><A NAME="s3">3. Usage </A></H2>

<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.1">3.1 General Usage</A>
</H2>

<P>Yammi makes extensive use of context menus (right-click on item).
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.2">3.2 Scanning harddisk</A>
</H2>

<P>The first step is to get your songs into Yammis database by having your harddisk scanned.
<P>For this to work, you need to check the configuration (->Preferences) and make sure,
that the directory "baseDir" is existing and has the following structure
<P>- baseDir
<P>|
<P>|- trash
<P>|- corrupted
<P>|- other directories containing all mp3 songs
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.3">3.3 Selecting songs</A>
</H2>

<P>Once you have some or all of your songs in the database, you can either use the
search function to search for songs, or use the folder structure that is
provided automatically to access and organise your songs.
<P>
<H3>Searching</H3>

<P>Type in anything into the search field, Yammi shows you the nearest matches!
<P>That's basically it, simple but effective, just give it a try
(e.g. horribly misspelling songs your looking for...)
Yammi looks into title, artist, album for similarities.
<P>
<H3>Folder structure</H3>

<P>The following folder structure is provided automatically:
<P>
<H3>Folder "All Music"</H3>

<P>Contains all songs in database
<P>
<H3>Folder "Now Playing"</H3>

<P>Contains the currently played song, plus the last n played songs
(while Yammi was running)
<P>
<H3>Folder Albums (Artists)</H3>

<P>Contains a subfolder for every album (artist) for which there are more than 5
songs in the database.
<P>
<H3>Folder Media</H3>

<P>Contains a subfolder for every media that you prepared with Yammi.
This enables you to quickly find, on which media you have backup copies of songs.
Later, this should also enable you to play songs that are not on harddisk,
by automatically requesting a media that contains this song.
<P>
<H3>Folder Playlists</H3>

<P>This folder contains "categories" of songs, that can be created and filled by you.
<P>
<H3>Folder Unclassified</H3>

<P>This folder contains all songs that are not appearing in either
<P>- a playlist
<P>- in the folder "Artists"
<P>- or the folder "Albums"
<P>
<H3>Folder Search Results</H3>

<P>This folder keeps the result of the last search process.
<P>Mp3 files can still be organized in a directory structure.
There should be one base directory for all mp3s, eg. /mp3/
Yammi searches for new songs recursively in that directory.
Yammi keeps its own database of songs with all necessary information
(artist, title, album, filename, ...). This song databse is saved as a simple xml
file in the user's home directory under $HOME/.Yammi/songdb.xml.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.4">3.4 Song Actions</A>
</H2>

<P>Clicking on a song with the right mouse button, the context menu allows you the
following actions:
<P>
<H3>Enqueue</H3>

<P>Enqueues a song to the end of xmms' playlist.
<P>
<P>
<H3>Enqueue as next</H3>

<P>Enqueues a song as the next song to play in xmms' playlist.
(does not result in next song if xmms is in shuffle play mode)
<P>
<H3>Play immediately</H3>

<P>First enqueues the song as next, then tells xmms to skip to next song.
<P>
<H3>Insert into...</H3>

<P>Here you can insert a song into an existing playlist.
<P>
<H3>Info...</H3>

<P>Opens a dialog with info and edit possibility for the selected song(s).
If more than one song was selected, this enables a convenient mass-editing
possibility:
<P>Mass Editing
<P>For multiple selected songs the song info dialog is a little different:
<P>- time and size of all selected songs are added (eg. useful for checking how many songs
fit on one CD)
<P>- entries that are not exactly the same for all selected are shown as "!".
As long, as this is not changed, these entries are not touched.
When you change this entry, you can conveniently set that entry for all selected
songs to the new value.
<P>- entries that are exactly the same can be conveniently changed for all selected
songs by changing the value shown.
<P>
<P>
<H3>Delete</H3>

<P>Delete the song from the database, and move the mp3 file to the trash directory.

<H2><A NAME="ss3.6">3.6 Burning files</A>
</H2>

<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.7">3.7 Preferences</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.8">3.8 Updating song database</A>
</H2>

<P>For new songs found under the base directory, Yammi tries to get the song info
such as artist, title, album... right by looking at the id3 tags (v1.0 or v1.1)
and the filename. If Yammi is not sure about the tags, it will ask.
Finally, the new songs are added to Yammi's database.
<P>Updating song database does not touch your mp3s.
Exception: If a new song is already existing, either the new or old version will
be moved to a "trash" directory.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.9">3.9 Making database consistent with songs</A>
</H2>

<P>It is recommended to make newly added songs consistent with the database,
ie. to add id3 tags if not existing and to rename the file to the
"artist - title.mp3" convention.
This also facilitates file handling outside of Yammi.
<P>Performing this step touches your mp3s, changes tags, changes filenames!!!
No guarantee that no damage is done to your files...:)
Especially take care of characters not allowed in filenames, or songs
that have the same artist and title identifiers.
