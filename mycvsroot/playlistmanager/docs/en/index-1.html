<P>Please keep in mind: This documentation needs some update...
<P>Yammi is a handy tool to manage your mp3 songs. It can
<P>- scan your harddisk for mp3 files and generate a song database
<P>- conveniently search for songs/artists/albums (fuzzy search)
<P>- send selected songs to xmms (enqueue or play directly)
<P>- organize your songs in categories
<P>- help saving your mp3 collection on media (such as CD-Rs)
<P>- edit and keep your song information consistent (id3 tags, filenames)
<P>
<P>The program was born because I was unhappy with the conventional approach to
manage your mp3s in a directory hierarchy and access them via normal file
open dialogs. The feature I like most about it is the fuzzy search possibility -
you type in something that's similar to the song or group or album that you are
searching for...and Yammi will show you the nearest matches.
(For me this works great. I don't know why other mp3 tools or programs such
as Addressbook almost never use such a feature.)
<P>This is a pretty early alpha version and my first project with qt, kdevelop and linux,
sorry for any consequences of that! Although I tried my best,
I can take no liability that my program
is not causing any damage to your mp3 collection.
<P>Any help to make this project more professional is very welcome, just contact me.
