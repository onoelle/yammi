last update 12.5.2003


user wishes:
------------
- rating of tracks
- subfolders
- loading of playlists (m3u) / document saving via plugin


for version 1.0
---------------
- "rescan tags"-button in song info dialog or in consistency check?
- make configurable/auto-detected forbidden characters: http://osdev.berlios.de/osd-fs.html
- check: moving songs in playlist not possible (on Mandrake, rpm?)
- {wish} in playlist: noatun stops playing
- preserve file permissions on modifying ogg tags
- polish GUI... (esp. the "butt ugly" icons?)
- no crossfading with noatun: replace workaround to avoid pauses in playback between songs
- removing a song from playlist: only remove this one (idea: function "removeDuplicates" for playlist?)
- update database: select a single file
- on deleting a song: delete in *all* lists (history, categories, ...)
- write little random(int range) method?
- plugin: publish a sample plugin (echo...) with all replacements
- folder for recent additions to database?
- remove symlinking for "burn to media": provide "physical categories"?
- add to consistency check: update option for re-reading layer/tag info from existing songs
  - updating tags from outside of Yammi => update info in Yammi
- => reach stable status!!!


probably for version 1.x
------------------------
- song length <X s: do not use crossfading?
- remove the creating of symlinks for burning assistance (but check size of existing media!)
- for both media players:
  - use QProcess for XMMS? (noatun?)
  - skip forward/backward when stopped
- fix: two albums having the same name appear as one album (heuristic: same album if in same dir?)
- page up and down keys don't work after searching
- load m3u files into a category
- wrongly calculated song length for some songs, VBR? (tom, 8.12., )
- evaluate TCON TTIT1 frame (tom, 8.12.)
- use QProcess instead of system() calls? (prelisten, xmms, noatun, shutdownscript, ...)

- cleanup
  - clean up yammigui.h (protected/public) !!! (oh oh...)
  - clean up other classes (eg. folder)...
- optimize startup time and behaviour
- swap management: in song: method getFilename() vs. getRealFilename() (fast)???
- speed up loading of categories? (binary search)
- xmms lock file?  => not easy to determine whether xmms is running or just lock file present
  maybe start xmms with QProcess?
- incorrect track numbers if track number not present (tom) => maybe problem of old id3lib?
- simplify {wish} system: (make every entry with empty filename (no media) a wish?
- playing songs not contained in Yammi's database might confuse yammi (noatun/xmms)
- new icon set for song actions (enqueue, playnow, ...)
- split left tree into two lists: automatic folders and user folders?
- stopping prelistening: cleaner approach with QProcess???
- saveFilename/renaming of file in song.cpp
- update database: text log window
- search for similar: add an option to search for songs played "near" this one
- statistic folder / more info in history folder
- more options for burning folder


KNOWN BUGS
----------
- a {wish} song causes noatun playback to stop
- floating point exception when scanning wav file???
- still problem of freezing xmms => xmms_remote_playlist_delete(0, 0)
	(seems to be a bug in xmms, posted to bugs@xmms)
- window geometry: sometimes window position gets shifted by the window decoration towards right lower corner
- problems with filenames containing "ß"? (problem of qt/linux on fat filesystem?)
- incorrect tracknumbers are shown in some cases where tracknumber is undefined (0) ?
