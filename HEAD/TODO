KNOWN BUGS
----------
- doesn't show meaningful value for bitrate and length when variable bitrate

- some mp3s appear as corrupted, although xmms can play them
  (layer information not readable for Yammi?)

- still problem of freezing xmms => xmms_remote_playlist_delete(0, 0)
	(seems to be a bug in xmms, posted to bugs@xmms)


for release 0.7beta
-----------------
- key events (shift/control/ skip im)
- saving tags?
- columns


to shutdown kde in a better way:

dcop ksmserver ksmserver "logout" 0 2 0   (what's the third param for?)

to play a file with noatun:
dcop noatun-1734 Noatun addFile "/mm/mp3/inbox/tiziano ferro - perdono.mp3" 0  (or 1, for playing immediately)


- dialog+options for updating database (together with scan media)
- on deleting a song: delete in all lists (history, categories, ...)
- save more session settings?
  - column width? order? for each folder?
  - current folder?
- replace id3 tag handling (and mp3 layer info?) with id3lib
- try to improve speed of listview (heaps slower in qt3?)
  - change linked list to vector or dictionary in MyList???
- provide a proper, tgz binary release
- encapsulate communication with mp3 player in a "Player" class
- saveFilename/renaming of file in song.cpp
- change copyTo / copyAsWavTo to plugins
- extensive testing with new user!!!
- clean up folder class
- clean up a lot...and complete documentation
- alternative to mp3burn? own script?
- dialog for burning files on cd/cdrecord plugin?
- folder for recent additions to database?
- specific messages on yammi update when starting
- more tool tips
- update database: more information+statistics at the end
- reach stable status


for "sometime"
--------------
- make a proper kde3 app out of it or port to windows???
- search for similar: add an option to search for songs played "near" this one
- statistic folder / more info in history folder
- more options for burning folder
- more options for keeping consistency
- more evaluation of log info
  - playing songs that haven't been played for quite a while
- fix: two albums having the same name appear as one album
- (generic) support for other music formats (at least wav?)
