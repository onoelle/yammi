- window geometry: sometimes window position gets shifted by the window decoration towards right lower corner
- problems with filenames containing "ß"? (problem of qt/linux on fat filesystem?)
- deleting a song that is currently played, then pressing "current" => crash

for 0.7
- check consistency check (and consistencyModes!)

  or: disable update actions while scanning...

-----
- xmms lock file?  => not easy to determine whether xmms is running or just lock file present
