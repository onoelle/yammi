	(seems to be a bug in xmms, posted to bugs@xmms)
- window geometry: sometimes window position gets shifted by the window decoration towards right lower corner
- problems with filenames containing "ß"? (problem of qt/linux on fat filesystem?)
- deleting a song that is currently played, then pressing "current" => crash

0.7.2
-----
- xmms lock file?  => not easy to determine whether xmms is running or just lock file present
