last update 25.02.2004

- clean up the content of this file!!!


for version 1.2
---------------
main purpose: clean up, so other people can more easily contribute to the project

- check KActions
- implement moving files

- check conformance to kde standards, such as:
  - conforming to standard kde i18n schema
  - check icons: transparency, remove old ones
  - check lsm file
  - replace tr() with i18n()
  - replace qDebug / cout with kdDebug? different loglevel?

- clean up CVS repo
- check bugs on sf
- check all TODOs / FIXMEs
- make proposed filename change while you change things
- fix song info for multiple songs
- make mpg123 and ogg123 configurable?
- implement onPlayed and afterPlayed plugin types
- make follow symlinks a configurable option?
- fix or delete child-safe mode
- on startup: progress bar when loading database
- fix second view menu / behaviour on hiding columns the first time
- implement skip backwards in artsplayer
- handle unplayable files (wishes, text files) => introduce file types and different behaviour

for version 1.0.1
-----------------
- check again: crash on clearing playlist including currently played song?
- check skip backward functionality & filling up songPlayed list!!!
- if you start yammi, while xmms has a song in its play list and then enqueue
  and play a song in yammi, the song previously played in xmms is played instead.
- deal with "unplayable files" (pictures, texts) in playlist (dequeue on 2. position?)
- finish documenting requirements for compiling in handbook


later...
--------
- add new plugin types: "on song played", "after song played"
- rating of tracks
- subfolders
- history of visited folders + "go back" button
- any ripping plugin? have a look at existing ripping programs suitable to be called as plugin
- xml export plugin?
- make configurable/auto-detected forbidden characters: http://osdev.berlios.de/osd-fs.html
- {wish} in playlist: noatun stops playing
- polish GUI... (esp. the "butt ugly" icons?)
- no crossfading with noatun: replace workaround to avoid pauses in playback between songs
- on deleting a song: delete in *all* lists (history, categories, ...)
- write little random(int range) method?
- plugin: publish a sample plugin (echo...) with all replacements
- remove symlinking for "burn to media": provide "physical categories"?


even later...
-------------
- song length <X s: do not use crossfading?
- remove the creating of symlinks for burning assistance (but check size of existing media!)
- for both media players:
  - use QProcess for XMMS? (noatun?)
  - skip forward/backward when stopped
- fix: two albums having the same name appear as one album (heuristic: same album if in same dir?)
- page up and down keys don't work after searching
- use QProcess instead of system() calls? (prelisten, xmms, noatun, shutdownscript, ...)

- swap management: in song: method getFilename() vs. getRealFilename() (fast)???
- speed up loading of categories? (binary search)
- xmms lock file?  => not easy to determine whether xmms is running or just lock file present
  maybe start xmms with QProcess?
- simplify {wish} system: (make every entry with empty filename (no media) a wish?
- playing songs not contained in Yammi's database might confuse yammi (noatun/xmms)
- split left tree into two lists: automatic folders and user folders?
- stopping prelistening: cleaner approach with QProcess???
- saveFilename/renaming of file in song.cpp
- update database: text log window
- search for similar: add an option to search for songs played "near" this one


KNOWN BUGS
----------
- sometimes noatun playlist will not be correctly cleared
  => effect: noatun stops on enqueueing a song
  => workaround: you have to look at both noatun instances and clear their playlist manually
- a {wish} song causes noatun playback to stop
- floating point exception when scanning wav file???
- still problem of freezing xmms => xmms_remote_playlist_delete(0, 0)
	(seems to be a bug in xmms, posted to bugs@xmms)
- window geometry: sometimes window position gets shifted by the window decoration towards right lower corner
- problems with filenames containing "ß"? (problem of qt/linux on fat filesystem?)
- incorrect tracknumbers are shown in some cases where tracknumber is undefined (0) ?
