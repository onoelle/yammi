last update 8.3.2003



for release 0.8.0
-----------------
- read all emails since 0.7!!!

- pack for distribution:
  - update handbook
  - update credits
  - update homepage: move requirements and install into handbook?
  - hack the configure script?

- category folder: autoplay menu???
- check: failing to load a media => crash? (tom)

0.8.1
-----
- Yammi running without valid player: create DummyPlayer class instead of all if(player!=0)
- plugin: publish a sample plugin (echo...) with all replacements
- document command line option: baseDir in handbook
- for both media players:
  - use QProcess for XMMS? (noatun?)
  - skip forward/backward when stopped
- move rpms to sourceforge download server/system
- update current listview after song has been played: entry lastPlayed
- fix: two albums having the same name appear as one album (heuristic: same album if in same dir?)
- extensive testing with new user!!!
- page up and down keys don't work after searching
- load m3u files into a category
- wrongly calculated song length for some songs, VBR? (tom, 8.12., )
- evaluate TCON TTIT1 frame (tom, 8.12.)
- remove/replace "current" button?
- removing a song from playlist: only remove this one (idea: function "removeDuplicates" for playlist?)
- adding to media: don't add entries already existing
- folder for recent additions to database?
- on deleting a song: delete in *all* lists (history, categories, ...)
- use QProcess instead of system() calls? (prelisten, xmms, noatun, shutdownscript, ...)
- check consistency check (and consistencyModes!)
- add to consistency check: update option for re-reading layer/tag info from existing songs
- updating genre tag from outside of Yammi => update info in Yammi

- cleanup
  - clean up yammigui.h (protected/public) !!! (oh oh...)
  - clean up other classes (eg. folder)...
- polish GUI... (esp. the "butt ugly" icons?)
- optimize startup time and behaviour
- swap management: in song: method getFilename() vs. getRealFilename() (fast)???
- speed up loading of categories? (binary search)
- xmms lock file?  => not easy to determine whether xmms is running or just lock file present
  maybe start xmms with QProcess?
- incorrect track numbers if track number not present (tom) => maybe problem of old id3lib?
- update database: more information+statistics at the end
- update database: select a single file
- simplify {wish} system: (make every entry with empty filename (no media) a wish?
- => reach stable status!!!

for future releases
-------------------
- playing songs not contained in Yammi's database might confuse yammi (noatun/xmms)
- new icon set for song actions (enqueue, playnow, ...)
- split left tree into two lists: automatic folders and user folders?
- stopping prelistening: cleaner approach with QProcess???
- restoring window geometry issue
- provide a proper tgz binary release or rpm? provide translation ability? (po-file?)
- saveFilename/renaming of file in song.cpp
- more tool tips
- update database: text log window
- search for similar: add an option to search for songs played "near" this one
- statistic folder / more info in history folder
- more options for burning folder


KNOWN BUGS
----------
- floating point exception when scanning wav file???
- still problem of freezing xmms => xmms_remote_playlist_delete(0, 0)
	(seems to be a bug in xmms, posted to bugs@xmms)
- window geometry: sometimes window position gets shifted by the window decoration towards right lower corner
- problems with filenames containing "ß"? (problem of qt/linux on fat filesystem?)
- deleting a song that is currently played, then pressing "current" => crash
