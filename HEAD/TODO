last update 30.1.2003


KNOWN BUGS
----------
- floating point exception when scanning wav file???
- still problem of freezing xmms => xmms_remote_playlist_delete(0, 0)
	(seems to be a bug in xmms, posted to bugs@xmms)
- window geometry: sometimes window position gets shifted by the window decoration towards right lower corner
- problems with filenames containing "ß"? (problem of qt/linux on fat filesystem?)
- deleting a song that is currently played, then pressing "current" => crash

for noatun support
------------------
swap management: in song: method getFilename() vs. getRealFilename() (fast)???

email to noatun:
- no access to any other but first song
- addFile(foo, false): no access any more to programmatically start playing!

for release 0.7.1
-----------------
- plugin: publish a sample plugin (echo...) with all replacements

- F1 does not work, if stopped?

- on deleting a song: delete in *all* lists (history, categories, ...)
- check consistency check (and consistencyModes!), add warning window when renaming/overwriting tags
- alternative to mp3burn? => test Tom's script

- add to consistency check: update option for re-reading layer/tag info from existing songs
- updating genre tag from outside of Yammi => update info in Yammi

- extend the autoplay functionality

- test jukebox functionality
- check: failing to load a media => crash? (tom)

- folder for recent additions to database?
- cleanup
  - update documentation
  - clean up yammigui.h (protected/public) !!! (oh oh...)
  - clean up other classes (eg. folder)...
- adding to media: don't add entries already existing
- speed up loading of categories? (binary search)
- wrongly calculated song length for some songs, VBR? (tom, 8.12., )
- evaluate TCON TTIT1 frame (tom, 8.12.)
- remove/replace "current" button?
- removing a song from playlist: only remove this one (idea: function "removeDuplicates" for playlist?)
- => reach stable status!!!

0.7.2
-----
- xmms lock file?  => not easy to determine whether xmms is running or just lock file present
- dequeue not working??? when I tested, it worked for me...? (tom)
- incorrect track numbers if track number not present (tom) => maybe problem of old id3lib?
- update database: more information+statistics at the end
- update database: select a single file
- simplify {wish} system: (make every entry with empty filename (no media) a wish?

for future releases
-------------------
- new icon set for song actions (enqueue, playnow, ...)
