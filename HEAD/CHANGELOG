######################
29.11.2002 version 0.7
- successfully compiled on sourceforge's compile farm on
  - RedHat 7.3
- added --disable-ogglibs and --disable-id3lib configure switches to disable linking aginst these libs
- some bugfixes
- added a (very primitive) autoplay function for a category
- added experimental writing of ogg tags
  (only the tags corresponding to id3v1 tags will be written, other tags will get lost)


##########################
28.9. 2002 version 0.7beta
- improved playlist management: last played song now also gets deleted from playlist when xmms stops
- started supporting session management (saving database before shutdown)
- started using an abstract "MediaPlayer" class to prepare support for other media players than xmms
- cleaned up menu structure
- added support to extract header from ".wav" files to extract length and bitrate from wave files
- column order and position in songlistview gets remembered, saved and restored
- maybe still not working correct: restoring session geometry:
  => reported x/y-position *sometimes* gets shifted by size of decorations...strange!
- new icon set for media player controls (ie. currently only xmms controls)
- added basic support for .ogg files (Thanks to Philip Scott!):
  - only reading ogg tags, no saving implemented yet
- new id3 layer reading, handles VBR correctly
  (thanks to Gustav Munkby and his CMP3Info class, see http://home.swipnet.se/grd/mp3info/mp3doc.html)
- new mechanism to read id3 tags (now using id3lib, see http://www.id3lib.org)
- improved plugin configuration: uniformly dealing with song and playlist plugins
- added a dialog for scanning harddisk and media, allowing:
  - option to check existence of files in Yammi's database, if necessary update or delete the entry
  - scan arbitrary files (eg. ".mp3 *.ogg *.wav", ...anything you like)
    (however, only on mp3 files and (new!) ogg files Yammi will be able to read tag information)
- successfully tested dcop commands for sending a song to noatun / shutting down kde in a regular way
  => see new plugin page on homepage for examples



#########################
13.8.2002   version 0.6.1
- bugfix: removed the #include "id3/tag.h", to make Yammi compile without id3lib installed

- Yammi finally gets an individual icon (for titlebar and kicker)

- improved handling of customlist in playlist plugin
  (gets written/read from a file now instead of simply inserted into the command)

- bugfix: all defined playlist plugins show up in context menu now


#####################
19.5.   version 0.5.3

- changed database format: primary key now is artist + title + album!!!
	(The necessary updates to your categories and history file will be done automatically
	on first start.)
- corrected the format of the database XML file (was not 100% correct XML)
  (Will be corrected automatically on first start, too.)
