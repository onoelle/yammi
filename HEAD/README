Yammi - Yet Another Music Manager I...

Please visit http://yammi.sourceforge.net for detailed information about Yammi.

Note:

Yammi now depends on
- id3lib (for reading id3 tags)
- libvorbis / libvorbisfile (and libvorbis-dev) (for reading ogg tags)

...but these dependencies can be switched off!

If you don't have these libraries (and end up with linking errors when trying to compile),
use the following switches to the configure script to disable the use of these libraries:

--disable-id3lib  (disables the use of id3lib => no id3 tags can be read/written from/to mp3 files)
--disable-ogglibs (disables the use of libvorbis/libvorbisfile => no ogg tags can be read/written from/to ogg files)


For example, use
./configure --disable-id3lib --disable-ogglibs
to disable both options. When finishing

Note that in this case, you have to fill in tag information yourself
(although Yammi tries to extract artist and title from the filename).



Enjoy using Yammi...
