Yammi - Yet Another Music Manager I...

Please visit http://yammi.sourceforge.net for detailed information about Yammi.

PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE COMPILING:

Yammi has some dependencies that can be switched off:

id3lib
------
Needed for reading id3 tags. Recommended if you use mp3 files.
(http://www.id3lib.org)
To disable:
--disable-id3lib         (=> no id3 tags can be read/written from/to mp3 files
                             layer information (bitrate, length) is still available)

libvorbis / libvorbisfile / libvorbis-dev
-----------------------------------------
Needed for reading ogg tags. Recommended if you use ogg files.
To disable:
--disable-ogglibs        (=> no ogg tags can be read/written from/to ogg files,
                             no ogg layer information (bitrate, length) available)

xmms
----
Needed for xmms support. Required if you use Xmms as your media player.
To disable:
--disable-xmms           (=> disables xmms support)


kdecore
-------
Needed for noatun support (for using dcop). Required if you use Noatun as your media player.
To disable:
--disable-noatun         (=> disables noatun support)


As you need a media player, you can't switch off both xmms and noatun support (well, you can, but...).


For example, use
./configure --disable-ogglibs --disable-noatun
to disable support for ogg files and disable noatun support.


Install path
------------
The default install path is /usr/local/


Enjoy using Yammi...
