Yammi - Yet Another Music Manager I...

Since version 0.7 Yammi depends on id3lib and libvorbis / libvorbisfile for reading id3 and ogg tags.

If you don't use mp3 files or don't use ogg files, you can disable the support for mp3 and/or ogg,
and can compile Yammi without the corresponding libraries.
By default, support for both formats is given.

To disable support for either of them => edit the file yammi/options.h

Please visit http://yammi.sourceforge.net for detailed information about Yammi.



I hope it compiles, so you can enjoy using Yammi...
