Yammi - Yet Another Music Manager I...

Please visit   http://yammi.sourceforge.net   for detailed information about Yammi.

PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING, if you have problems with compiling
via the normal configure/make/make install procedure...

Yammi has some dependencies/requirements that can be switched off:

kdecore (http://www.kde.org)
----------------------------
Needed for noatun support (via using dcop). Required if you use Noatun as your media player.
To disable:
--disable-noatun         (=> disables noatun support)

id3lib (http://www.id3lib.org)
------------------------------
Needed for reading id3 tags. Recommended if you use mp3 files.

To disable:
--disable-id3lib         (=> no id3 tags can be read/written from/to mp3 files
                             layer information (bitrate, length) is still available)

libvorbis / libvorbisfile / libvorbis-dev (http://www.xiph.org/ogg/vorbis/)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Needed for reading ogg tags. Recommended if you use ogg files.

To disable:

--disable-ogglibs        (=> no ogg tags can be read/written from/to ogg files,
                             no ogg layer information (bitrate, length) available)

xmms (http://www.xmms.org)
--------------------------
Needed for XMMS support. Required if you use XMMS as your media player.
To disable:
--disable-xmms           (=> disables xmms support)


For example, use
./configure --disable-ogglibs --disable-noatun
to disable support for ogg files and disable noatun support.

Note:
If you don't have either XMMS or Noatun support compiled in, Yammi only has limited functionality.


Install path
------------
The default install path is /usr/local. If this is not the desired path,
use the --prefix switch to change the install path.
For example, use
./configure --prefix=/opt/kde3
and the binary should be installed as /opt/kde3/bin/yammi



Problems???
-----------
As I am not an expert in configure scripts and makefiles, the provided ones might not work
on your system and configuration.
If you can't compile yammi at all, please drop me a short email with the error message along
with some information about your configuration (QT+KDE version, distribution, id3lib version, ...),
hopefully I can fix it for the next version.
If you know why it fails and can fix it, even better, but please drop me a note, too... THANKS!!!


Known workarounds if compilation fails
**************************************


QT libs not found
-----------------
try one of the following (change the location to the location where your qt libs are):
./configure --with-qt-includes=/usr/include/qt3
./configure --with-extra-libs=/opt/kde3/lib

ID3_NR_OF_V1_GENRES' undeclared
-------------------------------
Compilation stops with an error like
CMP3Info.cpp: In function `static int CMP3Info::getMaxGenreNr()':
CMP3Info.cpp:175: `ID3_NR_OF_V1_GENRES' undeclared (first use this function)

1. get a newer id3lib version (recommended)
2. patch CMP3Info.cpp:

I hope you enjoy using Yammi...
