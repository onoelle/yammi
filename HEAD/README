Yammi - Yet Another Music Manager I...

Since version 0.7 Yammi depends on id3lib and libvorbis / libvorbisfile for reading id3 and ogg tags.

I would like to make these dependencies configurable,
(ie. disable ogg vorbis support with a --disable-OGG flag to the configure script)
but haven't figured out how to do that - any help is appreciated!


So the following is not of much use yet:

If you don't use mp3 files or don't use ogg files, you can disable the support for mp3 and/or ogg,
and can compile Yammi without the corresponding libraries.
By default, support for both formats is compiled in.

To disable support for either of them => edit the file yammi/options.h

Please visit http://yammi.sourceforge.net for detailed information about Yammi.



I hope it compiles, so you can enjoy using Yammi...
