<toc>

<sect>Introduction<p>
Yammi ("Yet Another Music Manager I...") is a tool to manage your mp3 collection.
It is centered around an intuitive graphical user interface and a song database,
which allows convenient and fast access to any mp3 songs.
For playing songs the program uses XMMS
(<htmlurl url="http://www.xmms.org" name = "X MultiMedia System">).
So far, Yammi only supports Xmms and the mp3 format.<p>

Yammi enables you to

- conveniently search for songs (fuzzy search)

- organize your songs into playlists/categories

- keep statistics (when/how many times was song x played?)

- easily keep your song info, id3 tags and filenames consistent

- burn your song collection on CDs

- act as a jukebox, loading song files on demand from removable media

- prelisten to songs on headphone to DJ your own party (needs a second sound device)

- invoke command-line tools such as mp3burn or cdlabelgen to burn CDs or generate labels using the
information from the song database

<p>
The feature that distinguishes this tool from others is probably the extremely powerful fuzzy (tolerant)
search function, that is still as intuitive and easy as it can get:
Type in anything that you are looking for (eg. artist, title, album, comment) and within a second Yammi
will provide a list of "best matches", using a clever fuzzy search algorithm.
Not knowing the exact spelling of titles or artists is not a problem any more, as Yammi will find them
anyway - even if you are horribly misspelling them in the search.
This fuzzy search works just as you would expect it, even with a few thousand songs in the database.
<p>

With Yammi you don't need to dig through your directory structure to find a particular song.
Yammi also offers to create playlists/categories of songs, and sort songs after
just every available information, eg. title, artist, length, most recently added songs,
most recently played, bitrate...
<p>

Yammi does as an excellent job on a party. In connection with Xmms'
<htmlurl url="http://www.netcologne.de/~nc-eisenlpe2/xmms-crossfade/" name="crossfading plugin">
(<htmlurl url="http://volnorm.sourceforge.net/" name="volume normalization"> might be useful, too)
and a second sound card (to listen to songs on a headphone) it almost replaces the DJ,
and is still extremely easy to use even for people with little computer experience.
<p>

Yammi does also a good job in replacing your CD-player. In connection with a infrared receiver and
<htmlurl url="http://sourceforge.net/projects/lirc/" name="LIRC"> its basic functions can be accessed
with a remote control, even enabling you to turn off your computer via remote control
(or let it play five more songs before shutting down).
<p>


Although I tried my best, I can take no liability that Yammi is not causing any damage
to your mp3 collection, to your speakers or your neighbour...


<sect1>Changes
<p>
For changes, see the file CHANGELOG included in the distribution.
<p>

<sect>Installation
<p>
<sect1>How to obtain Yammi
<p>
Give it a try at <htmlurl url="yammi.sourceforge.net" name = "The Yammi Homepage">
or email me at <htmlurl url="mailto:oli.noelle@web.de" name="oli.noelle@web.de">

<sect1>Requirements
<p>
Yammi needs Qt 3.x and Xmms 1.2.6.

If you want to decode mp3s to wav files or listen to songs on a second soundcard
you need mpg123.

If you want to use the ripping and encoding function performed by the script "yammiGrabAndEncode"
you need cdparanoia and (not)lame, for details have a look at the script.

<sect1>Compilation and installation
<p>

In order to compile and install Yammi on your system, type the following in
the base directory of the Yammi distribution:

<tscreen><verb>
% ./configure
% make
% make install
</verb></tscreen>

This should install the executable "yammi" and two additional scripts
("yammiGrabAndEncode" and "yammiShutdownScript") in /usr/local/bin/.

<p>
Since Yammi uses <verb>autoconf</verb> you should have not trouble
compiling it.
Should you run into problems please report them to the the author at 
<htmlurl url="mailto:oli.noelle@web.de" name = "oli.noelle@web.de">
<p>

<sect1> Deinstallation <p>
In the base directory of the yammi distribution, type

% make uninstall

If you are not upgrading to a new version of yammi, but want to completely
remove all files related to yammi from your harddisk,
you can also delete the directory .yammi in your home directory.
(This deletes your preferences, categories and the complete database!)

<sect1> Starting the first time <p>
After successful installation, you can start yammi by typing "yammi" in a shell
(if you encounter any problems or want to know what's going on it helps to have
a look at the terminal output that yammi creates on the console).
On the first start, yammi will create a directory ".yammi" in your home directory,
where it will store the song database, preferences settings and logfiles.
Before you start scanning your harddisk for songs, you should edit the preferences
(File -> Preferences) and set the paths to the location of your mp3 collection.

<sect> Usage <p>
<sect1> General Usage <p>
The general usage of the program should be pretty intuitive:

On the left, you have a list of folders, each containing a list of songs or subfolders.

On the right, you have a list of songs, with different attributes shown in different
columns.

Use the left folder list to pick a selection of (or all) songs, then the right list to
pick one (or more) songs to play, edit, categorise, ...

The most important actions are available in the toolbar, the others are available from
the menu or context menu (right-click on a song or a folder).
<p>


<sect1> Scanning harddisk
<p>
The first step is to get your songs into Yammis database by having your harddisk scanned.

For this to work, you should check the configuration (File->Preferences) and make sure
that the directory "base directory for scanning" is pointing to the base directory of your mp3 collection.
Also, give a path for "trash directory for deleted song files", as this directory is needed when
you want to delete songs within yammi (yammi does not delete the files, but moves them
to this directory and skips this directory when scanning for new songs).

After setting the preferences, you can perform a database update (File->Update Database),
which will insert all found songs into the yammi database.
Also see "Updating Database" in "Advanced Topics".

There is also a menu entry for scanning removable media (File->Scan Removable Media),
which can be used eg. to scan a CD. In contrast to scanning the harddisk,
Yammi's database won't contain path + filename information for those songs
found on scanning a removable media. Instead, these songs need to be loaded
into a swap directory to play them. Also see "Removable Media Managements" in
"Advanced Topics".

<sect1> Searching
<p>
Type in anything into the search field, Yammi immediately shows you the nearest matches, rated with
a percentage. (You can configure the threshold for the shown matches in the preferences.)

That's basically it, simple but effective, just give it a try
(e.g. horribly misspelling songs your looking for...)
Yammi looks into title, artist, album and comment for similarities.

Yammi will automatically switch to the folder "Search Results" whenever you type
in anything into the search field. Ctrl-F or ESC set the focus to the search field
and clear it.

<sect1> Song information <p>
In the songlist there is one row per song, containing various information
about the song.
The following columns are available:

(* = corresponds to id3 tag info, + = extracted from mp3 layer info)

artist*

title*

album*

length+

year*

track*

genre*

addedTo

bitrate+

path

filename

comment*

last played


Depending on the chosen folder, there may be additional columns. So far these are:

Match (folder "Search Results")

Pos (folder "Playlist" and "Categories")

Played on(folder "SongsPlayed" and "History")

Reason (folder "Problematic Songs")


<sect1> Song coloring <p>

The songs entries in the songlist are normally written in black, except:

currently played song (red)

song enqueued in playlist (blue)

song already played in this session (green)

song not available on local harddisk or swap (grey) (=> needs to be loaded before playing)

song available in swap dir (dark grey) (=> song is already loaded, will be only
checked for folder "Playlist")

<sect1> Folder structure <p>
The following folder structure is provided automatically:

<sect2> Folder "All Music" <p>
Contains all songs in the Yammi database

<sect2> Folder "Playlist" <p>
Contains all songs that are still to play, plus the currently played song.

This is the only folder (besides the categories) where you can move songs around
to change the order of the songs to play.
(You can't drag a song to the top, which is the currently played song.)
Please note that you can only drag songs if the folder is ordered
ascending after the first column ("Pos", this is the default when you click on
this folder)

<sect2> Folder Albums (Artists, Genre) <p>
Contains a subfolder for every album (artist, genre) for which there are more than 5
songs in the database.

<sect2> Folder Categories <p>
This folder contains "categories" (or "playlists") of songs,
that can be created and filled by the user.
(Adding a song to a category: right-click on song, and choose "Insert into...").
The subfolders itself can be ordered by dragging the songs to the desired
location. Please note that you can only drag songs if the folder is ordered
ascending after the first column ("Pos", this is the default when you click on
this folder)

<sect2> Folder History <p>
This folder contains the history of played songs, each song shown with the
timestamp when it was played. For played songs to be logged, you need to activate
"logging of played songs" in the preferences. This folder only contains the
songs loaded from the history file at startup. Songs played in this session will
be appended to the folder "Songs Played".

<sect2> Folder Songs Played <p>
Contains all songs that have been played in this session of Yammi, together with
a timestamp. When Yammi terminates, these songs will be appended to the history
file, appearing in the folder "History" the next time Yammi starts.

<sect2> Folder Media <p>
Contains a subfolder for every media (eg. CD) that you prepared with Yammi.
When burning mp3 files to a CD with the help of Yammi, the program records the
location of songs to its database.
This enables you to quickly find on which media you have backup copies of songs.
In future releases, this should also enable you to play songs that are not on
your harddisk, by automatically requesting a media that contains this song.

<sect2> Folder Problematic Songs <p>
This Folder contains songs that were found problematic when performing a
consistency check (eg. songs contained twice).

<sect2> Folder Search Results <p>
This folder contains the result of the last search process.

<sect2> Folder Unclassified <p>
This folder contains all songs that are not appearing in either

- a category

- the folder "Artists"

- the folder "Albums"

This folder can help you organizing your songs into categories.

<sect2> Directory structure <p>
Mp3 files can still be organized in a directory structure according to your own needs.
Yammi keeps its own database of songs with all necessary information
(artist, title, album, filename, ...). This song databse is saved as a simple xml
file in the user's home directory under $HOME/.yammi/songdb.xml.
You should take care not to move your songfiles around from outside Yammi,
because Yammi will not find the files any more.
Yammi provides a function to move song files,
where at the same time the information in the Yammi database is updated.
Please make use of that function when you need to reorganize your songs on your
harddisk.
When you moved songs from outside Yammi, you can also perform an "Update Database",
then Yammi tries to figure out those songs that have been moved and updates the
corresponding information in its database.


<sect1> Song Actions <p>
Clicking on a song with the right mouse button, the context menu allows you the
following actions (most of them are available on the toolbar, too):

<sect2>Play...<p>
...Enqueue - Enqueues a song to the end of Yammi's playlist.

...Enqueue as next - Enqueues a song as the next song to play in Yammi's playlist.

...Play immediately - First enqueues the song as the very next to play, then causes a song change, so the song
is immediately played.

...Dequeue - Dequeues a song from Yammi's playlist, ie. removes all occurrences of this song
in Yammi's playlist.

<sect2>Prelisten to...<p>
(only available if a second sound device is configured in the preferences)

...start - Immediately starts playing the song via the second sound device, starting from the beginning.

...middle - Immediately starts playing the song via the second sound device, starting in the middle.

...end - Immediately starts playing the song via the second sound device, starting close to the end.

<sect2>Info...<p>
Opens a dialog with info and edit possibility for the selected song(s).
The dialog shows the different fields that Yammi saves in its database.
If more than one song was selected, this enables convenient mass-editing of songs:
<p>
Mass Editing<p>
For multiple selected songs the song info dialog is a little different:

- time and size of all selected songs are summed up (eg. useful for checking how
many songs fit on one CD)

- entries that are not exactly the same for all selected songs are shown as "!".
  As long, as this is not changed, these entries are not touched.
  When you change this entry, you can conveniently set that entry for all selected
  songs to the new value.

- entries that are exactly the same can be conveniently changed for all selected
  songs by changing the value shown.


<sect2>Insert into...<p>
Here you can insert one or more songs into an existing category or remove them.
The icon in front of the category name shows whether the song(s) will be added or
removed from the category. A check means that the song(s) is already contained.
Selecting a category with a check will remove the song(s) from it.


<sect2>Search for similar...<p>
This allows you to quickly search for songs from the same artist (or album or title)
as the selected song. It simply gets the information you requested from the song
and performs the usual fuzzy search with it.

<sect2>Advanced...<p>

Delete -
Deleting can be done in two ways:

Deleting the database entry in Yammi's database (does not touch the song file).

Deleting the song file, which is done by moving the song file to the trash directory.
Yammi still keeps the database entry (the song may be present on some media, and
copied to the harddisk before playing).

Copy file to... - Asks for a directory and copies the mp3 file to it.

Copy file as WAV to... - Asks for a directory, uses mpg123 to decode the mp3 file and copies it to the directory.

Move file to... - Moves a file to another directory. The path information in Yammi's database will
be updated with the new location of that file.

Check consistency - Performs a consistency check on the selected song(s).
See consistency modes.

Burn to media... - assists in burning the selected songs to a media
(see "Burning files" in "Advanced Topics")


<sect1> Preferences<p>

You can set the preferences via the menu: File -> Preferences

Most items should be self-explanatory if you read the tool tips provided
(stay over an item with mouse cursor for a while).

Consistency Mode

These settings determine, whether Yammi checks and modifies the id3
tags and filenames of your
mp3 collection. If both are acivated this has the following effect:

If you change eg. the title of a song via Yammi's song info dialog, Yammi will
not only change the entry in its internal database, but also
the id3 tags and the filename accordingly the next time it saves its database.
Yammi uses the schema "artist - title.mp3" for naming the files,
but first tries to remove all characters that are possibly not allowed in
filenames (on linux as well as windows (vfat) file systems),
however no guarantee can be given that "strange" artist or title entries
don't cause any problems with naming the files...
Please let me know about problems concerning the naming of files, so I can fix
them.

If you don't want Yammi to touch your mp3 files in any way, you should
leave these two settings disabled!
However, for easy organizing your song files I found it extremely useful
to have consistent filenames and tags at any time.

See also "Checking consistency" in "Advanced topics".


Group Threshold

This value determines, how many items of one group must be present for a
subfolder within the folder Artist/Albums/Genre to be created. If you set this
value to 1, every artist/album/genre will appear as a subfolder, a value of 10
only will create subfolders for artists/albums/genres which contain at least 10
songs.

<sect1> Key bindings <p>
The following key bindings exist:

ESC:	clear search field and focus it (CTRL-F should also work)

F1:	Play / Pause

F2:	Skip backward				(SHIFT-F2 skips without crossfading)

F3:	Skip forward				(SHIFT-F3 skips without crossfading)

F4:	Stop playing

F5:	Add song to end of playlist

F6:	Play song as next

F7:	Play song immediately  (SHIFT + F7: play immediately without crossfading)

F8:	Dequeue selected		(SHIFT + F8: Dequeue all)

F9:	Prelisten to start

F10:	Prelisten to middle

F11:	Prelisten to end

F12:	Stop prelistening

PAUSE:	Enable/disable sleep mode, see "Sleep mode" under "Advanced topics"

Page Up and Page Down: increase or decrease the number of songs for Yammi sleep mode
(only takes effect, if Yammi is in sleep mode)

Ctrl-S:	Save song database


<sect> Advanced topics <p>

<sect1> Checking consistency <p>
The menu offers the possibility to check your complete database for consistency.
This is a tool meant to help you organize your song collection.

The following aspects will be checked:

- Songfiles existing and readable

- No song contained twice in the database.

For that, the songs are considered the same if they have the same artist, title and
album.
These three fields serve as the primary key for the database.
As Yammi uses this primary key for identification (eg. for logging and categories),
you should never have more than one song with the same primary key.
On addings songs to your database, Yammi will add a "(2)" to the song title if the
added song's primary key is already existing.

- consistent id3 tags and filename

If the corresponding entries in the preferences are enabled, it is checked
whether the songfile has consistent id3 tags and a consistent filename.
(ie. tags are the same as the entries in Yammi's database, and filename is
"artist - title.mp3").



After checking consistency, the folder ProblematicSongs contains all the
inconsistent songs that were found. A column "reason" explains why a song was
found to be not consistent. This allows to resolve any inconsistencies.
If any songs with inconsistent tags or filenames were found, these will be
corrected the next time you save the database.


<sect1> Burning files <p>

For assistance in burning files to a CD, do the following:

1. select the songs you want to burn

2. In the context menu of the songlist choose "Advanced"->"Burn to Media".

3. You will be asked for a name and a start index for that collection of songs.

4. Now Yammi will create directories (in the .yammi subdirectory of your home
directory) named after the collection name you gave and an index.
Songs will be inserted in the current order of your songlist. For example
if you order your songs after artist in the songlist, and invoke this function,
you might end up with all songs from artists "Abba" to "Guano Apes" on your
media 1, "Hanson" to "..." on media 2, and so on...
In each directory, Yammi
will put symbolic links to the corresponding files on your harddisk. Yammi will
take care that in one directory there won't be more songs than the maximum
medium size given in the preferences (burning folder, size of media).
If you set this value to 700 MB, you can comfortably distribute a big folder
(or all your music) over multiple 700 MB CDs.

For burning the songs to CD, please use another program (eg. X-CDRoast) and
simply burn the content of each of the collection's folder to a CD.
Take care to check the feature "follow symbolic links" in the options of the
burning program.

Yammi also remembers on which media a song is contained.
This allows to delete song files from harddisk to save space,
and let Yammi request the corresponding media the next time the song is in the playlist,
so that the song can be loaded from the media on demand.


<sect1> Playlist management of yammi <p>

Yammi takes over the playlist management of xmms and has its own folder
named "Playlist" where you can move songs up and down, remove them from the
playlist, or directly retrieve information about them.
Yammi always tries to keep 5 (or the number that is configured in Yammi's preferences)
songs in the Xmms playlist. When a song finished
playling, Yammi will remove it from the playlist, and fill up the playlist
again.
You should not directly modify the playlist of Xmms any longer, as Yammi might overwrite
your song ordering or songs added from within Xmms. Yammi also disables
the random play setting of Xmms, as this would confuse Yammi's playlist management.

When Yammi is terminated, it writes all songs from its playlist back to the
Xmms playlist (in that way, Yammi does not need to save the current playlist,
as Xmms does it when it is terminated correctly).
When Yammi starts the next time, it reads the current playlist
of Xmms and again takes over the playlist management.

<sect1> Updating song database <p>
The "File" menu offers the possibility to update your database.

Yammi starts in the directory given in the preferences and recursively
scans your harddisk for new songs. It looks at all files ending with
".mp3" (case insensitive) and checks, whether the song is already contained
in Yammi's database.
For all new songs found, Yammi tries to get the song information such as
artist, title, album... by looking at the id3 tags (v1.0 or v1.1).
If id3 tags are not present, Yammi tries to extract the information from the
filename by looking for a seperating "-" and takes everything to the left of
the seperating dash as the artist, everything to the right as the title
(corresponding to the "artist - title.mp3" schema). If no seperating dash or
more than one are found, Yammi puts the newly added file into the ProblematicSongs
folder with an explanation to check artist or title.
If the filename contains an artist or title that is longer than 30 characters,
and the tags contain only the first 30 characters (as this is the limit for id3v1.1),
Yammi tries to take the full name from the filename (Yammi's database has basically no
restriction for the length of the entries).

Updating your song database does not touch your mp3s.
Exception: If a new song is already existing, either the new or old version will
be moved to your configured trash directory.

<sect1> Scanning removable media <p>
The "File" menu also offers to scan a removable media. This is quite similar
to scanning your harddisk. The difference is that the songs added to Yammi's
database will not contain a path and filename, but instead will contain the
scanned media's name in their "contained on" media list.
This means that you can't directly play these songs, but have to enqueue them,
and load them from this media into the swap directory before playing.
If a song is already existing in the database, Yammi will just add the media
to its media list (if not contained already), so scanning a media twice should
not create any inconsistencies.


<sect1> Grabbing and encoding new songs <p>

Especially on a party it might come in handy to directly grab and encode
some songs from cd. Yammi offers a basic support for that (otherwise I am using
Krabber, which does a real good job on grabbing and encoding).
From the file menu, choose "Grab CD Track". You will be asked for track number,
artist and title. Then Yammi executes in the background the script
"grabandencode" (which is normally installed in /usr/local/bin/, just have a look),
which grabs the track from CD using paranoia, and then encodes it using lame.
(You might want to customize the script to fit your needs, eg. setting the
bitrate for lame, which is defaulting to 256kb/s).
When the script has finished, a new mp3 file exists in the directory given in the
preferences under "base directory for scanning".
Yammi informs you in the status bar that there is a new song available.
You manually have to perform a database update then to
get the song into the database.

If you want to customize this script, please adhere to the schema that the
output filename is only existing when the grabbing and encoding is completely
finished, because Yammi checks for availability of a file with the given name.

<sect1>Child-safe mode<p>
This mode is thought for parties to protect your mp3 collection, if other people
use Yammi. The following operations are not permitted, if this mode is switched
on:

- the complete "Advanced" submenu in the context menu is disabled

- delete files

- clear the complete playlist

- update song database

- check consistency

Once enabled, you can only disable this feature with a password, which is: "protect".
Alternatively, you could hack Yammi's preferences file.

Okay, this is NOT SAFE IN ANY WAY, it's just meant to protect users who have
very little knowledge of computers to do any harm to your mp3 collection by
accident.

<sect1>Sleep mode <p>
If you enable Yammi's sleep mode by pressing the button in the toolbar,
Yammi will shut down in the following two cases:

- the number of songs to play (visible and editable in the toolbar) has reached 0

- XMMS stops playback (only if it STOPS, PAUSING playback will have no effect)

The second case can be because of

- last song in playlist was played

- you pressed stop in XMMS or in Yammi

A dialog box appears giving you the possibility to cancel the shutdown.

If there is a shutdown script specified in the preferences, this script will be invoked on
shutting down.
This can be used to shutdown the computer, simulating the functionality of a timer on a stereo.
To shutdown your computer as a normal user, you might need to modify permissions to the
shutdown command (eg., as root do a "chmod 6755 /sbin/shutdown").
Be careful with changing permissions, as it may make your computer more vulnerable.

Be also careful with shutting down your computer in that way, as any open documents will not be saved
and running programs might not be terminated in a very soft way...
(Anyone knows how to shutdown KDE in a regular way from a script? Please let me know!)


<sect1> Removable Media Management <p>
Yammi has support to function as a "Jukebox". That is, you don't need all your
songfiles on your local harddisk, but can load them on demand from removable
media (such as CDs) into a swap directory. Yammi still keeps all songs in its
database to enable you to search and enqueue conveniently. However, before
enqueuing the songs to Xmms, Yammi will check for availability and enqueue only
those songs that are on the harddisk.

To use this jukebox functionality, you should first create a swap directory
on your harddisk and set the path and the size limit in the preferences.
(I recommend to create a special swap directory and not to use "/tmp/" as your
swap dir.)

To remove song files from your harddisk to gain disk space, but keep the song entries
in Yammi's database,
choose "Delete..." (from the context menu, "Advanced..."), and enable the checkbox
"delete file" (and leave the "delete database entry" checkbox disabled).
Take care only to remove song files that have a media location stored in their database
entry (you can check this when you select "Info..." in the song context menu),
or otherwise the deleted song will not be accessible anymore.

To scan a removable media and add all the contained songs to the database,
use "Scan removable media" from the file menu.

For the removable media management, Yammi has an extra toolbar consisting of
a media list and a "Load" button.
In the media list, Yammi collects all the media that are needed to load the songs
in Yammi's current playlist, the most urgent ones listed first.
(For songs that are available on more than one media, Yammi lists all possible media
in this list.)
From this media list, you simply select the media that you inserted into your
computer (eg. into your CD-Rom), and click "Load". Yammi will then load all
songs that it needs in its current playlist from this media into the swap directory
(given in the preferences). After loading, Yammi will update its playlist
(and the playlist of Xmms) and update the list of needed media to reflect the changes.

For the swap directory, you can give a size limit (also in the preferences).
If the size that all the swapped song files use in this directory increases
beyond the given limit, then Yammi will remove song files from that directory,
using a least-recently-used (LRU) strategy.


<sect1> External Scripts / Plugins <p>
Yammi offers support to call external programs with parameters like song titles
or filenames. This can be extremely useful when calling a script for burning mp3s
or a cd label generator. Then Yammi can even serve as a front-end for CD-Burning
or other tasks.

These plugins can be configured in Yammi's preferences, and are available via the
context menu in the songlist. There are two types of plugins, the first one
("Song plugin") is invoked for each song, the second one
("Songlist plugin") generates a list of items and invokes
a program on this list.

Please have a look at Yammi's website (yammi.sourceforge.net) for example configurations
for these plugins.


<sect1> Tips and tricks...<p>
Avoid having two songs with the same artist, title and album!
Yammi will get really confused...

Yammi communicates with Xmms session 0. If you have problems with the communication,
you might need to disable "Allow multiple instances" in Xmms (Preferences->Options).




<sect>Questions and Answers<p>

Why does Yammi delete all played songs from the xmms playlist?

It just does so. If you want to listen to a series of songs again, you can
select the songs in the "History" folder (where the songs are normally ordered
after the time when they were played).
