<H2><A NAME="s2">2. Installation</A></H2>

<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.1">2.1 How to obtain Yammi</A>
</H2>

<P>Give it a try at 
<A HREF="http://yammi.sourceforge.net">The Yammi Homepage</A>.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.2">2.2 Requirements</A>
</H2>

<P>
<H3>Mandatory</H3>

<P>Yammi needs Qt 3.x.
<H3>Optional</H3>

<P>For reading id3 tags, id3lib is required.
<P>For reading ogg tags and layer information, libvorbis and libvorbisfile are required.
<P>For listening to songs on a second soundcard during playback on your primary soundcard
you need mpg123 (for mp3 files), ogg123 (for ogg files) or play (for wav files).
<P>If you want to use the ripping and encoding function offered from within yammi,
you need cdparanoia and (not)lame, for details have a look at the script "yammiGrabAndEncode"
included in the distribution.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.3">2.3 Compilation and installation</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>In order to compile and install Yammi on your system, type the following in
the base directory of the Yammi distribution:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
% ./configure
% make
% make install
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>If compilation is successful, the executable "yammi" and an additional script
"yammiGrabAndEncode" will be installed in /usr/local/bin/.
<P>If you experience problems with compiling or installing, please consult the README file
included in the distribution
which explains various switches for the configure script that might be necessary on your system.
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.4">2.4 Deinstallation </A>
</H2>

<P>In the base directory of the yammi distribution, type
<P>% make uninstall
<P>If you are not upgrading to a new version of Yammi, but want to completely
remove all files related to Yammi from your harddisk,
you can also delete the directory ".yammi" in your home directory
(This deletes your preferences, categories, settings and the complete database!).
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.5">2.5 Starting the first time </A>
</H2>

<P>After successful installation, you can start yammi by typing "yammi" in a shell
(if you encounter any problems or want to know what's going on it helps to have
a look at the terminal output that yammi creates on the console).
On the first start, yammi will create a directory ".yammi" in your home directory,
where it will store the song database, preferences settings and logfiles.
Before you start scanning your harddisk for songs, you should edit the preferences
(Configure -> Settings...) and set the paths to the location of your song collection.
