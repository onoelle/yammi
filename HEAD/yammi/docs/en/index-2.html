<H2><A NAME="s2">2. Installation</A></H2>

<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.1">2.1 How to obtain Yammi</A>
</H2>

<P>Give it a try at 
<A HREF="http://yammi.sourceforge.net">The Yammi Homepage</A>.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.2">2.2 Requirements</A>
</H2>

<P>Yammi needs Qt 3.x and Xmms >= 1.2.6.
For reading id3 tags, id3lib is required (can be switched off, see below).
For reading ogg tags and layer information, libvorbis and libvorbisfile are required (can be switched off, see below).
<P>If you want to listen to songs on a second soundcard during playback on your primary soundcard
you need mpg123 (for mp3 files), ogg123 (for ogg files) or play (for wav files).
<P>If you want to use the ripping and encoding function performed by the script "yammiGrabAndEncode"
you need cdparanoia and (not)lame, for details have a look at the script included in the distribution.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.3">2.3 Compilation and installation</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>In order to compile and install Yammi on your system, type the following in
the base directory of the Yammi distribution:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
% ./configure
% make
% make install
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Pass the switches "--disable-id3lib" or "--disable-ogglibs" to the configure script,
if you don't have the required libraries.
As a result, tag reading will not be possible for the corresponding files.
For example, if you don't use ogg files, and don't have libvorbis and libvorbisfile installed
on your system, you have to use
<P>% ./configure --disable-ogglibs
<P>If compilation is successful, the executable "yammi" and an additional script
"yammiGrabAndEncode" will be installed in /usr/local/bin/.
(If this path does not exist, create this directory before installation, and move the executables to
any directory which is in your path afterwards.)
<P>
<P>Should you run into problems while compiling, please report them to the the author at
<A HREF="mailto:oli.noelle@web.de">oli.noelle@web.de</A> (please include
the output of the configure/make command in the email).
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.4">2.4 Deinstallation </A>
</H2>

<P>In the base directory of the yammi distribution, type
<P>% make uninstall
<P>If you are not upgrading to a new version of yammi, but want to completely
remove all files related to yammi from your harddisk,
you can also delete the directory .yammi in your home directory.
(This deletes your preferences, categories and the complete database!)
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.5">2.5 Starting the first time </A>
</H2>

<P>After successful installation, you can start yammi by typing "yammi" in a shell
(if you encounter any problems or want to know what's going on it helps to have
a look at the terminal output that yammi creates on the console).
On the first start, yammi will create a directory ".yammi" in your home directory,
where it will store the song database, preferences settings and logfiles.
Before you start scanning your harddisk for songs, you should edit the preferences
(Configure -> Settings...) and set the paths to the location of your song collection.
