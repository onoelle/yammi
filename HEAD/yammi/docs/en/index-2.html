<H2><A NAME="s2">2. Installation</A></H2>

<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.1">2.1 How to obtain Yammi</A>
</H2>

<P>Give it a try at 
<A HREF="http://yammi.sourceforge.net">The Yammi Homepage</A>.
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.2">2.2 Requirements</A>
</H2>

<P>
<H3>Mandatory</H3>

<P>Yammi needs 
<A HREF="http://www.trolltech.com/products/qt/">QT</A>, version 3.x
(including qt-devel for compiling).
<P>
<H3>Optional</H3>

<P>For reading id3 tags,
<A HREF="http://www.id3lib.org">id3lib</A>, version 3.8.2 or higher
is required (recommended: newest version 3.8.3).
<P>
<P>For reading ogg tags and layer information,
<A HREF="http://www.vorbis.com/download_unix.psp">libvorbis, libvorbisfile and libvorbis-dev</A>
are required.
<P>
<P>For XMMS support,
<A HREF="http://www.xmms.org">XMMS</A>, version 1.2.6 or later is required.
<P>
<P>For Noatun support,
the 
<A HREF="http://www.kde.org">KDE libraries</A>, version 3.x are required.
<P>
<P>Note: You should have either XMMS or Noatun support, or functionality will be very limited.
<P>For listening to songs on a second soundcard during playback on your primary soundcard
you need mpg123 (for mp3 files), ogg123 (for ogg files) or play (for wav files).
<P>If you want to use the ripping and encoding function offered from within yammi,
you need cdparanoia and (not)lame or other ripping/encoding tools, for details have a look
at the script "yammiGrabAndEncode" included in the distribution.
<P>If you want to use certain plugins you might need other programs
(such as k3b for the "Burn with K3b" plugins or cdlabelgen for the "Create CD Label" plugin).
<P>
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.3">2.3 Compilation and installation</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>In order to compile and install Yammi on your system, type the following in
the base directory of the Yammi distribution:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
% ./configure
% make
% make install
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>If compilation is successful, the executable "yammi" and an additional script
"yammiGrabAndEncode" will be installed in /usr/local/bin/.
<P>
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.4">2.4 Problems </A>
</H2>

<P>If you experience problems with compiling or installing, please consult the README file
included in the distribution
which explains various switches for the configure script that might be necessary on your system.
<P>If you still experience problems, try contacting the developers, not only including information
about the problem, but also about your system configuration. If possible, attach the
console log of configure and make.
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.5">2.5 Deinstallation </A>
</H2>

<P>In the base directory of the yammi distribution, type
<P>% make uninstall
<P>If you are not upgrading to a new version of Yammi, but want to completely
remove all files related to Yammi from your harddisk,
you can also delete the directory ".yammi" in your home directory
(This deletes your preferences, categories, settings and the complete database!).
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.6">2.6 Starting the first time </A>
</H2>

<P>After successful installation, you can start yammi by typing "yammi" in a shell
(if you encounter any problems or want to know what's going on it helps to have
a look at the terminal output that yammi creates on the console).
On the first start, yammi will create a directory ".yammi" in your home directory,
where it will store the song database, preferences settings and logfiles.
Before you start scanning your harddisk for songs, you should edit the preferences
(Configure -> Settings...) and set the paths to the location of your song collection.
