<P>Yammi ("Yet Another Music Manager I...") is a tool to manage and search your song collection
on your computer (eg. mp3, ogg and wav files).
It is centered around an intuitive graphical user interface and a song database,
which allows convenient and fast access to any songs.
For playing songs Yammi currently supports two media players, namely XMMS
(
<A HREF="http://www.xmms.org">X MultiMedia System</A>).
and
<A HREF="http://www.noatun.kde.org">Noatun</A>.
<P>
<P>Yammi enables you to
<P>- conveniently search for songs within seconds (fuzzy search)
<P>- organize your songs into playlists/categories
<P>- easily keep your song info (id3 and ogg tags) and filenames consistent
<P>- keep statistics (when/how many times was song x played?)
<P>- assist in burning your song collection to CDs (automatically distributing your songs over multiple media)
<P>- act as a jukebox, loading song files on demand from removable media/CDs
<P>- prelisten to songs on headphone while normal playback to DJ your own party (needs a second sound card)
<P>- invoke other programs or custom scripts such as k3b, cdlabelgen, ... to burn CDs, generate CD labels or execute
other commands, using the information from Yammi's song database
<P>
<P>The feature that distinguishes this tool from others is probably the extremely powerful fuzzy (tolerant)
search function, that is still as intuitive and easy as it can get:
Type in anything that you are looking for (eg. artist, title, album, comment) and within a second Yammi
will provide a list of "best matches", using a clever fuzzy search algorithm.
Not knowing the exact spelling of titles or artists is not a problem any more, as Yammi will find them
anyway - even if you are horribly misspelling them in the search.
This fuzzy search works just as you would expect it, even with a couple of thousand songs in the database.
Therefore you never ever have to dig through your directory structure to find a particular song.
<P>
<P>Yammi also offers a folder structure to organize your songs. Songs can be inserted automatically
into artist, album and genre folders, and the user can create custom folders (=playlists).
In each folder, songs can be sorted after
just every available information, eg. title, artist, length, most recently added songs,
most recently played, bitrate...
<P>
<P>Yammi does as an excellent job on a party. In connection with XMMS'
<A HREF="http://www.netcologne.de/~nc-eisenlpe2/xmms-crossfade/">crossfading plugin</A>
(
<A HREF="http://volnorm.sourceforge.net/">volume normalization</A> might be useful, too)
and a second sound card (to prelisten to songs on a headphone) it almost replaces the DJ,
and is still extremely easy to use even for people with little computer experience.
<P>
<P>Yammi does also a good job in replacing your CD-player. In connection with a infrared receiver and
<A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/lirc/">LIRC</A> its basic functions can be accessed
with a remote control, even enabling you to turn off your computer via remote control
(or let it play five more songs before shutting down).
<P>
<P>
<P>Although I tried my best, I can take no liability that Yammi is not causing any damage
to your song collection, your speakers or your neighbour...
