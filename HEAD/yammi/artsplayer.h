/** Media Player for direct comunication with Arts
    
    The ArtsPlayer is a MediaPlayer for Yammi, which comunicates
    directly with the Arts server, allowing Yammi to run "native"
    on top of KDE, without any intermediary, external players
    
    A difference from this player to the other MediaPlayers is
    that this one does not keep an "internal" playlist - it fetches 
    the next song directly from yammi's playlist
    
    While Yammi's interaction with the ArtsPlayer is not optimal ( they
    comunicate via the two signals playlistChanged() and statusChanged() )
    this is necessary to keep Yammi working with external players,like Xmms
    and Noatun
