last update 17.2.2002

KNOWN BUGS
----------
sometimes xmms seems to crash when inserting/deleting songs in xmms' playlist,
then yammi blocks until xmms is killed

for release 0.4
------------------------
- touch history file on first startup => yes, check whether funciona
- update documentation (esp. on grabbing/encoding songs)
- song slider for prelisten?

for release 0.4.1
-----------------
- new framework for view updates
- more tool tips
- statistic folder / more info in history folder

for near future
---------------
- more options for burning folder
- more options for keeping consistency
- more detailed logging + evaluation of log info
  - playing songs that haven't been played for quite a while

- fix: two albums having the same name appear as one album
- fix: doesn't show meaningful value for bitrate and length when variable bitrate
- fix: some mp3s xmms can play appear as corrupted
  (layer information not readable?)
	

for far future
--------------
- replace id3 tag handling (and mp3 layer info?) with something better
  (probably switching to id v2 tags, using a library)
- support for other music formats (at least wav, maybe ogg)
- port to windows?
- put it all into a proper database (upto 5000 songs I think it'll do as is)
