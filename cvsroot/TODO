todo (later)
------------
- replace id3 tag handling (and mp3 layer info?) with something better
  (probably switching to id v2 tags, using a library)
- port to windows?
- more detailed logging + evaluation of log info
  - playing songs that haven't been played for quite a while
- put it all into a proper database (upto 5000 songs I think it'll do as is)
