<sect>Introduction

<p>
Yammi is a tool to manage your mp3 songs. It can

- scan your harddisk for mp3 files and generate a song database (in xml)

- conveniently search for songs/artists/albums (fuzzy search)

- send selected songs to xmms (enqueue or play directly)

- organize your songs in categories (enabling a song to be in multiple categories)

- help burning your mp3 collection on CDs (by splitting the songs to burn
into suitable sets that can be burnt on CD)

- edit and keep your song information consistent (id3 tags, filenames, mass editing)

- help grabbing and encoding a track from cd to a mp3 file (using cdparanoia and lame)


The program was born because I was unhappy with the conventional approach to
manage your mp3s in a directory hierarchy and access them via normal file
open dialogs. The feature I like most about it is the fuzzy search possibility -
you type in something that's similar to the song or group or album that you are
searching for...and Yammi will instantly show you the nearest matches.
(For me this works great. I don't know why other mp3 tools or programs such
as Addressbook almost never use such a feature.)

This is my first project with qt, kdevelop and linux,
sorry for any consequences of that!
(Any help to make this project more professional is welcome, just contact me)

Although I tried my best, I can take no liability that my program
is not causing any damage to your mp3 collection or anything...


<sect1>Changes
<p>
For changes, see the file CHANGELOG included in the distribution.
<p>

<sect>Installation
<p>
<sect1>How to obtain Yammi
<p>
Give it a try at <htmlurl url="www.yammi.sourceforge.net" name = "The Yammi Homepage">
or email me at <htmlurl url="mailto:oli.noelle@web.de" name="oli.noelle@web.de">

<sect1>Requirements
<p>
The program was developed under Linux with qt2.3 and kde2.2.1,
but it does not use any KDE classes (so far).

So what you definitely need should be only qt 2.x and xmms 1.2.1 or later (X Multimedia System).

If you want to decode mp3s to wav files or listen to songs on a second soundcard
you need mpg123.

If you want to use the ripping and encoding function performed by the script "grabAndEncode"
you need cdparanoia and (not)lame, for details have a look at the script.

<sect1>Compilation and installation
<p>

In order to compile and install Yammi on your system, type the following in
the base directory of the Yammi distribution:

<tscreen><verb>
% ./configure
% make
% make install
</verb></tscreen>

This should install the executable "yammi" and two additional scripts
("yammiGrabAndEncode" and "yammiShutdownScript") in /usr/local/bin/.

<p>
Since Yammi uses <verb>autoconf</verb> you should have not trouble
compiling it.
Should you run into problems please report them to the the author at 
<htmlurl url="mailto:oli.noelle@web.de" name = "oli.noelle@web.de">
<p>

<sect1> Deinstallation <p>
In the base directory of the yammi distribution, type

% make uninstall

does it work???
If you are not upgrading to a new version of yammi, but want to completely
remove all files related to yammi from your harddisk,
you can also delete the directory .yammi in your home directory.
(This deletes your preferences, categories and the complete database!)

<sect1> Starting the first time <p>
After successful installation, you can start yammi by typing "yammi" in a shell.
On the first start, yammi will create a directory ".yammi" in your home directory,
where it will store the song database, preferences settings and logfiles.
Before you start scanning your harddisk for songs, you should edit the preferences
(File -> Preferences) and set the paths to the location of your mp3 collection.

<sect> Usage <p>
<sect1> General Usage <p>
The general usage of the program should be pretty intuitive:

On the left, you have a list of folders, each containing a list of songs or subfolders.

On the right, you have a list of songs, with different attributes shown in different
columns.

Use the left folder list to pick a selection of (or all) songs, then the right list to
pick one (or more) songs to play, edit, categorise, ...

The most important actions are available in the toolbar, the others are available from
the menu or context menu (right-click on a song or a folder).
<p>


<sect1> Scanning harddisk
<p>
The first step is to get your songs into Yammis database by having your harddisk scanned.

For this to work, you should check the configuration (File->Preferences) and make sure
that the directory "base directory for scanning" is pointing to the base directory of your mp3 collection.
Also, give a path for "trash directory for deleted song files", as this directory is needed when
you want to delete songs within yammi (yammi does not delete the files, but moves them
to this directory and skips this directory when scanning for new songs).

After setting the preferences, you can perform a database update (File->Update Database),
which will insert all found songs into the yammi database.
Also see "Updating database" in "Advanced topics".

<sect1> Searching
<p>
Type in anything into the search field, Yammi immediately shows you the nearest matches, rated with
a percentage. (You can configure the threshold for the shown matches in the preferences.)

That's basically it, simple but effective, just give it a try
(e.g. horribly misspelling songs your looking for...)
Yammi looks into title, artist, album and comment for similarities.

Yammi will automatically switch to the folder "Search Results" whenever you type
in anything into the search field. Ctrl-F or ESC set the focus to the search field
and clear it.

<sect1> Folder structure <p>
The following folder structure is provided automatically:

<sect2> Folder "All Music" <p>
Contains all songs in the Yammi database

<sect2> Folder "Playlist" <p>
Contains all songs that are still to play, plus the currently played song.

This is the only folder where you can move songs around to change the order
of the songs to play. (You can't drag a song to the top, which is the
currently played song.) You can't sort this list by clicking on one the column
headers.

<sect2> Folder Albums (Artists) <p>
Contains a subfolder for every album (artist) for which there are more than 5
songs in the database.

<sect2> Folder Categories <p>
This folder contains "categories" of songs, that can be created and filled by
you. (Adding a song to a category: right-click on song, and choose "Insert into...")

<sect2> Folder History <p>
This folder contains the history of played songs, each song shown with the
timestamp when it was played. For played songs to be logged, you need to activate
"logging of played songs" in the preferences.

<sect2> Folder Media <p>
Contains a subfolder for every media (eg. CD) that you prepared with Yammi.
When burning mp3 files to a CD with the help of Yammi, the program records the
location of songs to its database.
This enables you to quickly find on which media you have backup copies of songs.
In future releases, this should also enable you to play songs that are not on
your harddisk, by automatically requesting a media that contains this song.

<sect2> Folder Problematic Songs <p>
This Folder contains songs that were found problematic when performing a
consistency check (eg. songs contained twice).

<sect2> Folder Search Results <p>
This folder contains the result of the last search process.

<sect2> Folder Unclassified <p>
This folder contains all songs that are not appearing in either

- a playlist

- the folder "Artists"

- the folder "Albums"

This folder can help you organizing your songs into categories.

<sect2> Directory structure <p>
Mp3 files can still be organized in a directory structure according to your own needs.
Yammi keeps its own database of songs with all necessary information
(artist, title, album, filename, ...). This song databse is saved as a simple xml
file in the user's home directory under $HOME/.yammi/songdb.xml.
You should take care not to move your songfiles around from outside Yammi,
because Yammi will not find the files. Yammi provides a function to move song files,
where at the same time the information in the Yammi database is updated. Please make use
of that function when you need to reorganize your songs on your harddisk.


<sect1> Song Actions <p>
Clicking on a song with the right mouse button, the context menu allows you the
following actions (most of them are available on the toolbar, too):

<sect2>Play...<p>
...Enqueue - Enqueues a song to the end of Yammi's playlist.

...Enqueue as next - Enqueues a song as the next song to play in Yammi's playlist.

...Play immediately - First enqueues the song as the very next to play, then causes a song change, so the song
is immediately played.

...Dequeue - Dequeues a song from Yammi's playlist, ie. removes all occurrences of this song
in Yammi's playlist.

<sect2>Prelisten to...<p>
(only available if a second sound device is configured in the preferences)

...start - Immediately starts playing the song via the second sound device, starting from the beginning.

...middle - Immediately starts playing the song via the second sound device, starting in the middle.

...end - Immediately starts playing the song via the second sound device, starting close to the end.

<sect2>Info...<p>
Opens a dialog with info and edit possibility for the selected song(s).
The dialog shows the different fields that Yammi saves in its database.
If more than one song was selected, this enables convenient mass-editing of songs:
<p>
Mass Editing<p>
For multiple selected songs the song info dialog is a little different:

- time and size of all selected songs are summed up (eg. useful for checking how
many songs fit on one CD)

- entries that are not exactly the same for all selected songs are shown as "!".
  As long, as this is not changed, these entries are not touched.
  When you change this entry, you can conveniently set that entry for all selected
  songs to the new value.

- entries that are exactly the same can be conveniently changed for all selected
  songs by changing the value shown.


<sect2>Insert into...<p>
Here you can insert one or more songs into an existing playlist or remove them.
The icon in front of the playlist name shows whether the song(s) will be added or
removed from the playlist. A check means that the song(s) is already contained.
Selecting a playlist with a check will remove the song(s) from it.


<sect2>Search for similar...<p>
This allows you to quickly search for songs from the same artist (or album or title)
as the selected song. It simply gets the information you requested from the song
and performs the usual fuzzy search with it.

<sect2>Advanced...<p>

Delete -
Deleting can be done in two ways:

Deleting the database entry in Yammi's database (does not touch the song file).

Deleting the song file, which is done by moving the song file to the trash directory.
Yammi still keeps the database entry (the song may be present on some media, and
copied to the harddisk before playing).

Copy file to... - Asks for a directory and copies the mp3 file to it.

Copy file as WAV to... - Asks for a directory, uses mpg123 to decode the mp3 file and copies it to the directory.

Move file to... - Moves a file to another directory. The path information in Yammi's database will
be updated with the new location of that file.

Check consistency - Performs a consistency check on the selected song(s).
See consistency modes.


<sect1> Preferences<p>

You can set the preferences via the menu: File -> Preferences

Most items should be self-explanatory if you read the tool tips provided
(stay over an item with mouse cursor for a while).

Consistency Mode

These settings determine, whether Yammi checks and modifies the id3
tags and filenames of your
mp3 collection. If both are acivated this has the following effect:

If you change eg. the title of a song via Yammi's song info dialog, Yammi will
not only change the entry in its internal database, but also
the id3 tags and the filename accordingly the next time it saves its database.
Yammi uses the schema "artist - title.mp3" for naming the files,
but first tries to remove all characters that are possibly not allowed in
filenames (on linux as well as windows (vfat) file systems),
however no guarantee can be given that "strange" artist or title entries
don't cause any problems with naming the files...
Please let me know about problems concerning the naming of files, so I can fix
them.

If you don't want Yammi to touch your mp3 files in any way, you should
leave these two settings disabled!
However, for easy organizing your song files I found it extremely useful
to have consistent filenames and tags at any time.

See also "Checking consistency" in "Advanced topics".


<sect1> Key bindings <p>
The following key bindings exist:

ESC:	clear search field and focus it (CTRL-F should also work)

F1:	Play / Pause

F2:	Skip backward

F3:	Skip forward

F4:	Clear playlist

F5:	Add song to end of playlist

F6:	Play song as next

F7:	Play song immediately

F8:	Dequeue song

F9:	Prelisten to start

F10:	Prelisten to middle

F11:	Prelisten to end

F12:	Stop prelistening

PAUSE:	shutdown yammi and/or computer, see "Shutdown script" under "Advanced topics"

Page Up and Page Down: increase or decrease the number of songs until Yammi shuts down
(only takes effect, if PAUSE was pressed before)

Ctrl-S:	Save song database


<sect> Advanced topics <p>

<sect1> Checking consistency <p>
The menu offers the possibility to check your complete database for consistency.
This is a tool meant to help you organize your song collection.

The following aspects will be checked:

- Songfiles existing and readable

- No song contained twice in the database.

For that, the songs are considered the same if they have either
the same artist and the same title, or the same filename.
As Yammi uses the artist-title combination for identification (eg. for logging),
you should never have more than one song with the same artist and title.
If you have different versions of one song, you can put the version info
into the title.

- consistent id3 tags and filename

If the corresponding entries in the preferences are enabled, it is checked
whether the songfile has consistent id3 tags and a consistent filename.
(ie. tags are the same as the entries in Yammi's database, and filename is
"artist - title.mp3").



After checking consistency, the folder ProblematicSongs contains all the
inconsistent songs that were found. A column "reason" explains why a song was
found to be not consistent. This allows to resolve any inconsistencies.
If any songs with inconsistent tags or filenames were found, these will be
corrected the next time you save the database (unless you disable it in the
preferences before saving).


<sect1> Burning files <p>

For assistance in burning files to a CD, do the following:

1. Put all the files you want to burn into one folder

2. In the context menu of that folder, choose "Folder"->"Burn folder...".

3. You will be asked for a name for that collection of songs.

4. Now Yammi will create directories (in the .yammi subdirectory of your home
directory) named after the collection name you gave and an index.
Songs will be sorted alphabetically (after artist). In each directory, Yammi
will put symbolic links to the corresponding files on your harddisk. Yammi will
take care that in one directory there won't be more songs than the maximum
medium size given in the preferences (burning folder, size of media).
If you set this value to 700, you can comfortably distribute a big folder
(or all your music) over multiple CDs.

For burning the songs to CD, please use another program (eg. X-CDRoast) and
simply burn the content of each of the collection's folder to a CD.
Take care to check the feature "follow symbolic links" in the options of the
burning program.

Yammi will also remember, on which media a song is contained. This should
be useful in later stages, so that songs can be swapped from harddisk, and Yammi
can request a matching media to load needed songs.


<sect1> Playlist management of yammi <p>

Yammi takes over the playlist management of xmms and has its own folder
named "Playlist" where you can move songs up and down, remove them from the
playlist, or directly retrieve information about them.
Yammi always tries to keep 3 songs in the xmms playlist. When a song finished
playling, yammi will remove it from the playlist, and fill up the playlist
again.
You should not modify the playlist of xmms any longer, as Yammi might overwrite
your song ordering or songs added from within xmms. Yammi also disables
the random play setting of xmms, as this would confuse Yammi's playlist management.

There seems to be a bug in the communication with xmms once in a while:
A call to xmms does not return (which freezes Yammi), and xmms' interface is frozen.
The current song will be played until the end. After killing xmms, the call
returns and Yammi can be used again... if anyone has any idea what causes this,
please let me know.

<sect1> Updating song database <p>
The "File" menu offers the possibility to update your database.

Yammi starts in the directory given in the preferences and recursively
scans your harddisk for new songs. It looks at all files ending with
".mp3" (case insensitive) and checks, whether the song is already contained
in Yammi's database.
For all new songs found, Yammi tries to get the song information such as
artist, title, album... by looking at the id3 tags (v1.0 or v1.1).
If id3 tags are not present, Yammi tries to extract the information from the
filename by looking for a seperating "-" and takes everything to the left of
the seperating dash as the artist, everything to the right as the title
(corresponding to the "artist - title.mp3" schema). If no seperating dash or
more than one are found, Yammi puts the newly added file into the ProblematicSongs
folder with an explanation to check artist or title.
If the filename contains an artist or title that is longer than 30 characters,
and the tags contain only the first 30 characters (as this is the limit for id3v1.1),
Yammi takes the full name from the filename (Yammi's database has basically no
restriction for the length of the entries).

Updating song database does not touch your mp3s.
Exception: If a new song is already existing, either the new or old version will
be moved to a "trash" directory.

<sect1> Grabbing and encoding new songs <p>

Especially on a party it might come in handy to directly grab and encode
some songs from cd. Yammi offers a basic support for that (otherwise I am using
Krabber, which does a real good job on grabbing and encoding).
From the file menu, choose "Grab CD Track". You will be asked for track number,
artist and title. Then Yammi executes in the background the script
"grabandencode" (which is normally installed in /usr/local/bin/, just have a look),
which grabs the track from CD using paranoia, and then encodes it using lame.
(You might want to customize the script to fit your needs, eg. setting the
bitrate for lame, which is defaulting to 256kb/s).
When the script has finished, a new mp3 file exists in the directory given in the
preferences under "base directory for scanning".
Yammi informs you in the status bar that there is a new song available.
You manually have to perform a database update then to
get the song into the database.

If you want to customize this script, please adhere to the schema that the
output filename is only existing when the grabbing and encoding is completely
finished, because Yammi checks for availability of a file with the given name.

<sect1>Child-safe mode<p>
This mode is thought for parties to protect your mp3 collection, if other people
use Yammi. The following operations are not permitted, if this mode is switched
on:

- the complete "Advanced" submenu in the context menu is disabled

- delete files

- clear the complete playlist

- update song database

- check consistency

Once enabled, you can only disable this feature with a password, which is: "protect".
Alternatively, you could hack Yammi's preferences file.

Okay, this is NOT SAFE IN ANY WAY, it's just meant to protect users who have
very little knowledge of computers to do any harm to your mp3 collection by
accident.

<sect1> Shutdown script <p>
If you press PAUSE, Yammi goes into shutdown(normal) mode:
It plays two more songs, and then automatically Yammi exits.

If you press PAUSE again, Yammi goes into shutdown(computer) mode:
Now it does not only exit from Yammi, but invokes a script which can eg.
shutdown your computer. The name of the script to invoke can be changed
in the preferences.
This feature is supposed to work like a timer on a stereo.

If you press PAUSE again, Yammi cancels the shutdown mode.

To increase or decrease the number of songs that will be played until shutdown,
you can use the Page Up or Down keys.



<sect>Questions and Answers<p>

Why does Yammi delete all played songs from the xmms playlist?

It just does so. If you want to listen to a series of songs again, you can
select the songs in the "History" folder (where the songs are normally ordered
after the time when they were played).
In future, Yammi might get playlist support, where some folders do have an order
and can be added to the playlist in that order.
