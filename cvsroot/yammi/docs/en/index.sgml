<sect>Introduction
<p>Please keep in mind: This documentation needs some update, it does not
really describe version 0.3, expect an updated documentation for version 0.4.

<p>
Yammi is a handy tool to manage your mp3 songs. It can

- scan your harddisk for mp3 files and generate a song database

- conveniently search for songs/artists/albums (fuzzy search)

- send selected songs to xmms (enqueue or play directly)

- organize your songs in categories

- help saving your mp3 collection on media (such as CD-Rs)

- edit and keep your song information consistent (id3 tags, filenames)

- help grabbing and encoding a track from cd to a mp3 file


The program was born because I was unhappy with the conventional approach to
manage your mp3s in a directory hierarchy and access them via normal file
open dialogs. The feature I like most about it is the fuzzy search possibility -
you type in something that's similar to the song or group or album that you are
searching for...and Yammi will show you the nearest matches.
(For me this works great. I don't know why other mp3 tools or programs such
as Addressbook almost never use such a feature.)

This is my first project with qt, kdevelop and linux,
sorry for any consequences of that!
Although I tried my best, I can take no liability that my program
is not causing any damage to your mp3 collection or anything...

Any help to make this project more professional is very welcome, just contact me.

<sect1>Changes
<p>
10.2.2002		version 0.3 released
5.12.2001   got an account on sourceforge, now heading towards my first release
13.8.2001		kind of first release
Jan  2001   project started
<p>

<sect>Installation
<p>
<sect1>How to obtain Yammi
<p>
Give it a try at <htmlurl url="www.yammi.sourceforge.net" name = "Yammi Homepage">
or email me at <htmlurl url="mailto:oli.noelle@web.de" name="Oliver Nölle">

<sect1>Requirements
<p>
For me it works with qt2.3 under kde2.2.1 (it worked fine with kde2.1)
It definitely needs qt 2.x, I'm not sure whether it really needs kde.
For playing mp3s it is tailored to xmms.
If you want to decode mp3s to wav files, or listen to songs on a second soundcard via headphone,
 you need mpg123.
There is a very simple ripping function using cdparanoia.

<sect1>Compilation and installation
<p>

In order to compile and install Yammi on your system, type the following in
the base directory of the Yammi distribution:

<tscreen><verb>
% ./configure
% make
% make install
</verb></tscreen>

<p>
Since Yammi uses <verb>autoconf</verb> you should have not trouble
compiling it.
Should you run into problems please report them to the the author at 
<htmlurl url="mailto:oli.noelle@web.de" name = "Oliver Nölle">

<sect> Usage <p>
<sect1> General Usage
<p>


<sect1> Scanning harddisk
<p>
The first step is to get your songs into Yammis database by having your harddisk scanned.

For this to work, you need to check the configuration (->Preferences) and make sure,
that the directory "baseDir" is existing and has the following structure

- baseDir

  |

  |- trash

  |- corrupted

  |- other directories containing all mp3 songs


<sect1> Selecting songs
<p>
Once you have some or all of your songs in the database, you can either use the
search function to search for songs, or use the folder structure that is
provided automatically to access and organise your songs.

<sect2> Searching
<p>
Type in anything into the search field, Yammi shows you the nearest matches!

That's basically it, simple but effective, just give it a try
(e.g. horribly misspelling songs your looking for...)
Yammi looks into title, artist, album for similarities.

<sect2> Folder structure
<p>
The following folder structure is provided automatically:

<sect3> Folder "All Music"
<p>
Contains all songs in database

<sect3> Folder "Playlist"
<p>
Contains all songs that are still to play, plus the currently played song.

<sect3> Folder Albums (Artists)
<p>
Contains a subfolder for every album (artist) for which there are more than 5
songs in the database.

<sect3> Folder Categories
<p>
This folder contains "categories" of songs, that can be created and filled by you.

<sect3> Folder History
<p>
This folder contains the history of played songs, each song given a timestamp
when it was played.

<sect3> Folder Media
<p>
Contains a subfolder for every media that you prepared with Yammi.
This enables you to quickly find, on which media you have backup copies of songs.
Later, this should also enable you to play songs that are not on harddisk,
by automatically requesting a media that contains this song.

<sect3> Folder Problematic Songs
This Folder contains songs that were found problematic when performing a
consistency check (eg. songs contained twice).

<sect3> Folder Search Results
<p>
This folder keeps the result of the last search process.

<sect3> Folder Unclassified
<p>
This folder contains all songs that are not appearing in either

- a playlist

- in the folder "Artists"

- or the folder "Albums"


Mp3 files can still be organized in a directory structure.
There should be one base directory for all mp3s, eg. /mp3/
Yammi searches for new songs recursively in that directory.
Yammi keeps its own database of songs with all necessary information
(artist, title, album, filename, ...). This song databse is saved as a simple xml
file in the user's home directory under $HOME/.Yammi/songdb.xml.

<sect1> Song Actions
<p>
Clicking on a song with the right mouse button, the context menu allows you the
following actions:

<sect2>Enqueue<p>
Enqueues a song to the end of xmms' playlist.


<sect2>Enqueue as next<p>
Enqueues a song as the next song to play in xmms' playlist.
(does not result in next song if xmms is in shuffle play mode)

<sect2>Play immediately<p>
First enqueues the song as next, then tells xmms to skip to next song.

<sect2>Insert into...<p>
Here you can insert a song into an existing playlist.

<sect2>Info...<p>
Opens a dialog with info and edit possibility for the selected song(s).
If more than one song was selected, this enables a convenient mass-editing
possibility:
<P>
Mass Editing<p>
For multiple selected songs the song info dialog is a little different:

- time and size of all selected songs are added (eg. useful for checking how many songs
fit on one CD)

- entries that are not exactly the same for all selected are shown as "!".
  As long, as this is not changed, these entries are not touched.
  When you change this entry, you can conveniently set that entry for all selected
  songs to the new value.

- entries that are exactly the same can be conveniently changed for all selected
  songs by changing the value shown.


<sect2>Delete<p>
Delete the song from the database, and move the mp3 file to the trash directory.


<sect1> Playlists<p>


<sect1> Burning files
<p>


<sect1> Preferences<p>

<sect1> Updating song database
<p>
For new songs found under the base directory, Yammi tries to get the song info
such as artist, title, album... right by looking at the id3 tags (v1.0 or v1.1)
and the filename. If Yammi is not sure about the tags, it will ask.
Finally, the new songs are added to Yammi's database.

Updating song database does not touch your mp3s.
Exception: If a new song is already existing, either the new or old version will
be moved to a "trash" directory.

<sect1> Making database consistent with songs
<p>
It is recommended to make newly added songs consistent with the database,
ie. to add id3 tags if not existing and to rename the file to the
"artist - title.mp3" convention.
This also facilitates file handling outside of Yammi.

Performing this step touches your mp3s, changes tags, changes filenames!!!
No guarantee that no damage is done to your files...:)
Especially take care of characters not allowed in filenames, or songs
that have the same artist and title identifiers.
