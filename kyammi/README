PROBLEMS???
-----------
Yammi has some dependencies/requirements that can be switched off:


id3lib (http://www.id3lib.org)
------------------------------
Needed for reading id3 tags. Recommended if you use mp3 files.

To disable:
--disable-id3lib         (=> no id3 tags can be read/written from/to mp3 files
                             layer information (bitrate, length) is still available)

libvorbis / libvorbisfile / libvorbis-dev (http://www.xiph.org/ogg/vorbis/)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Needed for reading ogg tags. Recommended if you use ogg files.

To disable:

--disable-ogglibs        (=> no ogg tags can be read/written from/to ogg files,
                             no ogg layer information (bitrate, length) available)

xmms (http://www.xmms.org)
--------------------------
Needed for XMMS support. Required if you use XMMS as your media player.
To disable:
--disable-xmms           (=> disables xmms support)


For example, use
./configure --disable-ogglibs
to disable support for ogg files.


Install path
------------
You should set KDEDIR to your global kde installation (eg. /opt/kde3) by calling
  export KDEDIR=/opt/kde3
before calling "./configure".
In that way you ensure that all files will be installed to the correct location.

You can also use the --prefix switch to the configure script to change the install path.
For example, use
./configure --prefix=/opt/kde3
and the binary should be installed as /opt/kde3/bin/yammi



Still problems???
-----------------
As I am not an expert in configure scripts and makefiles, the provided ones might not work
on your system and configuration.
If you can't compile yammi at all, please drop a short email to the yammi-developer mailing list
    yammi-developer@lists.sourceforge.net
with the error message along with some information about your configuration:
- KDE version
- QT version
- which distribution you are using
- the complete output of the ./configure command
Hopefully I can fix it for the next version.
If you know why it fails and can fix it, even better, patches are more than welcome... THANKS!!!


Known workarounds if compilation fails
**************************************

compiling on 64 bit systems
---------------------------
Maybe others need x86_64bit compile opts:
/configure --enable-libsuffix=64 --with-qt-dir=/usr/lib64/qt3 --with-qt-libraries=/usr/lib64/qt3/lib64 --prefix=/opt/kde3


"Import selected files" crashes while in KFileDialog
----------------------------------------------------
=> disable Preview funktionality (bug in KDE 3.2.1?)

Cannot delete files from within Yammi
-------------------------------------
on my system deleting songs (=moving their files to the trash dir) did not work when the trash dir
was configured to ~/Desktop/Trash
=> set it to another directory

QT libs not found
-----------------
try one of the following (change the location to the location where your qt libs are):
./configure --with-qt-includes=/usr/include/qt3
./configure --with-extra-libs=/opt/kde3/lib
