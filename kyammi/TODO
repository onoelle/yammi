last update 15.08.2004


for version 1.2-beta
--------------------
in progress:
- define and execute smoke tests (write little script with all configure options)

planned:
- handle unplayable files (wishes, text files) => 1. dequeue on second position or 2. introduce file types and different behaviour
check kde conformance:  
  - standard kde i18n schema: add a translation and test it
  - replace all couts with kdDebug/kdWarn/kdError
  - check lsm file
  - check icons: fix transparency or use standard ones, new application icon, check that it gets used
- clean up: song info for multiple songs
- saveFilename/renaming of file in song.cpp (there was something I can't remember)
- make proposed filename change while you type in songinfo dialog
- consistency check:
  - better dialog texts (which song is moved?, better explanations what happens/examples?)
- check dialog spacing & co (eg. guessing pattern!)
- fix: appropriate info messages on first startup/on importing old database
- fix: appropriate default size for yammi window on first startup
before release:
- fix i18n strings to be ready for internationalization
- check all TODOs / FIXMEs
- create a yammi entry on www.kde-apps.org
- update website
  - publish a sample plugin (echo...) with all replacements
  - publish sample plugin for html-export



for version 1.2
---------------
- implement onPlayed and afterPlayed plugin types
- on deleting a song: delete in *all* lists (history, categories, ...)
- make follow symlinks a configurable option?
- make replace playlist + position a configurable option?
- make mpg123 and ogg123 configurable?
- improve: yammi handbook (beautify, update)
- fix: integrate columns menu into view menu as a submenu
- reformat all files with kdevelop?
- simplify {wish} system: (make every entry with empty filename (no media) a wish?
- child safe mode?
- keep tags consistent mode?
- BUG: cannot sort files according to path => cannot reproduce this bug on my system
- fix all outstanding known bugs
- polish user interface
- add translation(s)?
- speedup startup by starting media players in background (noatun, xmms)
tag-related: (switch to taglib?)
- fix: 0-length ogg file makes yammi crash?
- CHECK: umlaute in tags?
media-player-related:
- fix: skipForward in noatun while still crossfading: take current volume as start of crossfading
- fix: xmms stopped, enqueue as next: does not work



for version 1.4
---------------
- re-add: enqueue/enqueueasnext random
- replace QListView with KListView
  - but beware of performance issues, see http://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=64608
  - and other QClasses too?
- amarok support?
- use Scott Wheelers taglib for reading metadata
- use a player thread for mediaplayer
- rating of songs
- allow subfolders for categories?


non-reproducable bugs
#####################
(given the date, when I could not reproduce the bug anymore)
- (15.08.) crash on clearing playlist including currently played song (which media player?)



ideas (for which I probably don't have the time to implement)
#############################################################
enhancements
------------
- music brainz support for tagging
- use audiocd kio slave for ripping?
- history of visited folders + "go back/go forward" buttons
- any ripping plugin? have a look at existing ripping programs suitable to be called as plugin
- xml export plugin?
- make configurable/auto-detected forbidden characters: http://osdev.berlios.de/osd-fs.html
- for xmms/noatun media players:
  - use QProcess for XMMS? (noatun?)
  - skip forward/backward when stopped
- separate folders into two categories: automatic folders and user-defined folders
- search for similar: add an option to search for songs played "near" this one
- integrate musicbrainz
- integrate: show cover of album
- kde panel applet with search field
- replace mediaplayer with "KMediaPlayer" interface for easier supporting other kde media players?

refactorings/fixes
------------------
- speed up loading of categories and history? (eg. binary search)
- remove symlinking for "burn to media": provide "physical categories"?
- fix: two albums having the same name appear as one album (heuristic: same album if in same dir?)
- page up and down keys don't work after searching
- use QProcess/KProcess? instead of system() calls? (prelisten, xmms, noatun, shutdownscript, ...)
- swap management: in song: method getFilename() vs. getRealFilename() (fast)???
- playing songs not contained in Yammi's database might confuse yammi (noatun/xmms)


KNOWN BUGS
----------
- a {wish} song causes noatun playback to stop
- floating point exception when scanning wav file???
- still problem of freezing xmms => xmms_remote_playlist_delete(0, 0)
	(seems to be a bug in xmms, posted to bugs@xmms, #855)
- incorrect tracknumbers are shown in some cases where tracknumber is undefined (0) ?
