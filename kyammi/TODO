non-reproducable bugs
#####################
(given the date, when I could not reproduce the bug anymore)
- (15.08.) crash on clearing playlist including currently played song (which media player?)
- (14.09.) cannot sort files according to path



ideas (for which I probably don't have the time to implement)
#############################################################
enhancements
------------
- music brainz support for tagging
- history of visited folders + "go back/go forward" buttons
- any ripping plugin? have a look at existing ripping programs suitable to be called as plugin
- xml export plugin?
- make configurable/auto-detected forbidden characters: http://osdev.berlios.de/osd-fs.html
- for xmms/noatun media players:
  - use QProcess for XMMS? (noatun?)
  - skip forward/backward when stopped
- separate folders into two categories: automatic folders and user-defined folders
- search for similar: add an option to search for songs played "near" this one
- replace mediaplayer with "KMediaPlayer" interface for easier supporting other kde media players?

refactorings/fixes
------------------
- speed up loading of categories and history? (eg. binary search)
- remove symlinking for "burn to media": provide "physical categories"?
- fix: two albums having the same name appear as one album (heuristic: same album if in same dir?)
- page up and down keys don't work after searching
- use QProcess/KProcess? instead of system() calls? (prelisten, xmms, noatun, shutdownscript, ...)
- swap management: in song: method getFilename() vs. getRealFilename() (fast)???


KNOWN BUGS
----------
- floating point exception when scanning wav file???
- still problem of freezing xmms => xmms_remote_playlist_delete(0, 0)
	(seems to be a bug in xmms, posted to bugs@xmms, #855)
- incorrect tracknumbers are shown in some cases where tracknumber is undefined (0) ?
