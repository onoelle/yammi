last update 24.01.2004

for version 1.2-final
---------------------
IN PROGRESS
- finish: translations (italian, spanish) (add portuguese?)

MUST-HAVE
- properly document tags consistent, filenames consistent and directories consistent mode
- confirm dialog when mass tagging
- fix: noatun stops playback sometimes
- add: publish plugin for html-export
- add: info message on first startup/on importing old database (or menu entry for importing?)
- add: warning if mass-tagging
- simplify {wish} system: (make every entry with empty filename (no media) a wish?
- child safe mode?
- proper screenshots for website / freshmeat
- song info dialog: disable ok button before any changes took place (filename check?)

Idea: Database -> Statistics... dialog:
- no songs
- total time (days)
- average time per song
- total space
- no of media
- average bitrate
- no of songs per artist
- no of artists
- no of albums
- ...history file: songs listened to?


NICE-TO-HAVE
- review kde conformance:  
  - replace all couts with kdDebug/kdWarn/kdError
  - check lsm file
- saveFilename/renaming of file in song.cpp (there was something I can't remember)
- implement onPlayed and afterPlayed plugin types
- on deleting a song: delete in *all* lists (history, categories, ...)
- improve: use dialog with textbox for properly displaying a plugin's command before executing
media-player-related:
- speedup startup by starting media players in background (noatun, xmms)
- fix: skipForward in noatun while still crossfading: take current volume as start of crossfading
- fix: xmms stopped, enqueue as next: does not work

for version 1.4
---------------
- use a player thread for mediaplayer
- rating of songs



non-reproducable bugs
#####################
(given the date, when I could not reproduce the bug anymore)
most recent first:
- (12.12.2004) zero-length ogg file makes yammi crash
- (12.12.2004) If you "Play now" a song that is already playing, Yammi crashes. 
  => cannot reproduce with xmms or noatun => only with artsplayer???
- (12.12.2004) I confirm too the crash when exiting yammi, it happens before yammi writes
 the config file, no matter what the player backend is.
  => cannot reproduce, maybe fixed with correctly terminating searchthread?
- (14.09.2004) cannot sort files according to path
- (15.08.2004) crash on clearing playlist including currently played song (which media player?)



ideas (for which I probably don't have the time to implement)
#############################################################
enhancements
------------
- history of visited folders + "go back/go forward" buttons
- any ripping plugin? have a look at existing ripping programs suitable to be called as plugin
- make configurable/auto-detected forbidden characters: http://osdev.berlios.de/osd-fs.html
- for xmms/noatun media players:
  - use QProcess for XMMS? (noatun?)
- separate folders into two categories: automatic folders and user-defined folders
- search for similar: add an option to search for songs played "near" this one

refactorings/fixes
------------------
- speed up loading of categories and history? (eg. binary search)
- remove symlinking for "burn to media": provide "physical categories"?
- fix: two albums having the same name appear as one album (heuristic: same album if in same dir?)
- use QProcess/KProcess? instead of system() calls? (prelisten, xmms, noatun, shutdownscript, ...)
- swap management: in song: method getFilename() vs. getRealFilename() (fast)???


KNOWN BUGS
----------
- still problem of freezing xmms => xmms_remote_playlist_delete(0, 0)
	(seems to be a bug in xmms, posted to bugs@xmms, #855)
