last update 01.06.2004


for version 1.2-alpha
---------------------
main purpose: clean up, so other people can more easily contribute to the project

- finish: mouse wheel handling on seekSlider
- check/resolve bugs on sf
- check all TODOs / FIXMEs
- handle unplayable files (wishes, text files) => 1. dequeue on second position or 2. introduce file types and different behaviour
- check dialog spacing & co (eg. guessing pattern!)
- icons for enqueing: add big "plus"
- 0 MB files => 560 Bytes shown in song info dialog?
- consistency check:
  - option to remove empty directories when moving songs
  - better dialog texts (which song is moved?, better explanations what happens/examples?)
- fix: progress dialog on plugins before confirmation

for version 1.2-beta
--------------------
check kde conformance:  
  - standard kde i18n schema: add a translation and test it
  - replace cout with kdDebug/kdWarn/kdError
  - check lsm file
  - check icons: fix transparency or use standard ones
- clean up: song info for multiple songs
- fix or delete child-safe mode
- fix: integrate columns menu into view menu
- make follow symlinks a configurable option?
- make mpg123 and ogg123 configurable?
- saveFilename/renaming of file in song.cpp (there was something I can't remember)
- make proposed filename change while you type
- implement onPlayed and afterPlayed plugin types
- check again: crash on clearing playlist including currently played song?
- check skip backward functionality & filling up songPlayed list!!!
- finish documenting requirements for compiling in handbook
- if you start yammi, while xmms has a song in its play list and then enqueue
  and play a song in yammi, the song previously played in xmms is played instead.
- on deleting a song: delete in *all* lists (history, categories, ...)
- write little random(int range) method?
- plugin: publish a sample plugin (echo...) with all replacements
- replace QListView with KListView
  - and other QClasses too?

for version 1.2
---------------
- simplify {wish} system: (make every entry with empty filename (no media) a wish?
- fix all outstanding known bugs
- polish user interface
- add translation(s)?


for version 1.4
---------------
- use Scott Wheelers taglib for reading metadata
- make yammi properly multithreaded
- rating of tracks
- allow subfolders for categories?


ideas (for which I probably don't have the time to implement)
#############################################################
enhancements
------------
- history of visited folders + "go back/go forward" buttons
- any ripping plugin? have a look at existing ripping programs suitable to be called as plugin
- xml export plugin?
- make configurable/auto-detected forbidden characters: http://osdev.berlios.de/osd-fs.html
- for xmms/noatun media players:
  - use QProcess for XMMS? (noatun?)
  - skip forward/backward when stopped
- separate folders into two categories: automatic folders and user-defined folders
- search for similar: add an option to search for songs played "near" this one
- integrate musicbrainz
- integrate: show cover of album
- kde panel applet with search field
- replace mediaplayer with "KMediaPlayer" interface for easier supporting other kde media players?

refactorings/fixes
------------------
- speed up loading of categories and history? (eg. binary search)
- remove symlinking for "burn to media": provide "physical categories"?
- fix: two albums having the same name appear as one album (heuristic: same album if in same dir?)
- page up and down keys don't work after searching
- use QProcess/KProcess? instead of system() calls? (prelisten, xmms, noatun, shutdownscript, ...)
- swap management: in song: method getFilename() vs. getRealFilename() (fast)???
- playing songs not contained in Yammi's database might confuse yammi (noatun/xmms)


KNOWN BUGS
----------
- sometimes noatun playlist will not be correctly cleared
  => effect: noatun stops on enqueueing a song
  => workaround: you have to look at both noatun instances and clear their playlist manually
- a {wish} song causes noatun playback to stop
- floating point exception when scanning wav file???
- still problem of freezing xmms => xmms_remote_playlist_delete(0, 0)
	(seems to be a bug in xmms, posted to bugs@xmms, #855)
- incorrect tracknumbers are shown in some cases where tracknumber is undefined (0) ?
