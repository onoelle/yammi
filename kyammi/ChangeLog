02.07.2004 version 1.2-alpha-3
##############################
Fixed some major bugs:
- fixed: importing old database
  (if you already used another 1.2-alpha version of yammi and have an empty song database now:
   if you delete the directory ~/.kde/share/apps/yammi, then yammi will automatically import your old
   database from ~/.yammi)
- fixed: updating id3 tags did not work if no tags were present in the file
- fixed: loading database from a given dir (using a command line parameter, try "yammi -h")
- fixed: connecting to xmms
- fixed: yammiui.rc not installed => aborting with correct error message
  (you have to have the yammiui.rc file correctly installed at (eg.) /opt/kde3/share/apps/yammi/yammiui.rc,
  please set KDEDIR to (eg.) /opt/kde3 before calling configure: "export KDEDIR=/opt/kde3")
- fixed: qt versions of .ui files (now QT >= 3.2 should be sufficient for compiling)
- fixed: fixed-size (g)char arrays: now using QString classes whenever possible
