MINOR CHANGES:

- removed configure option for "number of best matches" for fuzzy search

######################
24.10.2003 version 1.0

  (press multiple times to iterate over the best matches)

  (to quickly access all songs not contained on any media)

- added the possibility to ignore case in filename check (tick the checkbox in the settings)
- checking for existence of directory "categories" before saving, creating it if necessary

  see Database menu (as an alternative to recursively scanning a directory)
- added "Recent Additions" folder, yammi switches to that folder after scanning for songs
- moved all classes from mp3info into top-level folder (due to compilation issues)
- "dequeue" called from playlist now only dequeues the selected entry (if song more than once in playlist)

- fixed: deleting or moving a file should work, even if directory ends with slash



########################

  - replaced stdlib io functions with the corresponding QT file access methods
  - added "using namespace std" declarations (needed by gcc3.x compiler)
  - conformance to stricter rules of gcc3.2
  => successfully reported to compile with gcc3.2/QT3.1/KDE3.1rc3

- added --disable-ogglibs and --disable-id3lib configure switches to disable linking aginst these libs

- added a dialog box for configuring the consistency check
- improved "Burn to media" function: takes size of existing files into account
- Yammi now waits for Xmms to have started when it is not running yet

- for mp3 tag scanning, use of newest id3lib (3.8.2) is recommended!
  (problems of not recognized tags with older versions (probably, if both id3v1 and id3v2 tags present)

##########################
28.9. 2002 version 0.7beta

- cleaned up menu structure
- added support to extract header from ".wav" files to extract length and bitrate from wave files

- added basic support for .ogg files (Thanks to Philip Scott!):
  - only reading ogg tags, no saving implemented yet

- new mechanism to read id3 tags (now using id3lib, see http://www.id3lib.org)
- improved plugin configuration: uniformly dealing with song and playlist plugins
- added a dialog for scanning harddisk and media, allowing:
  - option to check existence of files in Yammi's database, if necessary update or delete the entry

    (however, only on mp3 files and (new!) ogg files Yammi will be able to read tag information)

  => see new plugin page on homepage for examples
