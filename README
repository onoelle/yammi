Yammi - Yet Another Music Manager I ...

Please visit   http://yammi.sourceforge.net   for detailed (but probably
outdated) information about Yammi.

After the porting to Qt4/5 a lot of functionality got not tested in depth.
Therefore it is likely there is something not working aside the normal
operations like scanning for mp3, playing them and grouping them in
categories. So you have been warned!



Dependencies:
-------------
- Qt library in version 5
- xine library, vlc library and/or qtmultimedia5.
- TagLib

This command should get you all development and runtime stuff you need:
  at Debian Stretch:
    apt install git build-essential libasound2-dev libtag1-dev libvlc-dev libxine2-dev qtbase5-dev qtmultimedia5-dev qttools5-dev-tools



Getting and building the source from GIT:
-----------------------------------------
  $ git clone git://git.code.sf.net/p/yammi/git yammi-git
  $ cd yammi-git/src
  $ export QT_SELECT=qt5
  $ qmake
  $ make all

And you are done. Right now you should be able to run Yammi from the source tree:
  $ ./yammi


Buidling a Debian package for Stretch:
--------------------------------------
  # apt install git debhelper build-essential libasound2-dev libtag1-dev libvlc-dev libxine2-dev qtbase5-dev qtmultimedia5-dev qttools5-dev-tools
  $ git clone git://git.code.sf.net/p/yammi/git yammi-git
  $ cd yammi-git
  $ dpkg-buildpackage -b -uc


The configuration lies in following files and directories:
  /home/user/.local/share/data/yammi/yammi
  /home/user/.local/share/yammi/yammi



Translations:
-------------
Currently the english and german languages should be in a good shape.
For spanish and italian I could not judge about it - you have to try it.
If they are not usable please delete the translations/yammi*.qm file for your locale.
Other translations are not included.


I hope you enjoy using Yammi...
