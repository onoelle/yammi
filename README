Yammi - Yet Another Music Manager I ...

Please visit   http://yammi.sourceforge.net   for detailed (but probably
outdated) information about Yammi.

After the porting to Qt4 a lot of functionality got not tested in depth.
Therefore it is likely there is something not working aside the normal
operations like scanning for mp3, playing them and grouping them in
categories. So you have been warned!



Dependencies:
-------------
- Qt library in version 4
- xine library
- TagLib

This command should get you all development and runtime stuff you need:
  at Debian Wheezy:
    apt-get install build-essential git libqt4-dev libxine2-dev libtag1-dev libasound2-dev libphonon-dev libvlc-dev libqxt-dev

  at Debian Jessie:
    apt-get install build-essential git gdb libqt4-dev libxine2-dev libtag1-dev libasound2-dev libphonon-dev libvlc-dev libqxt-dev   libxine2-plugins



Getting and building the source from GIT:
----------------------------
  $ git clone git://git.code.sf.net/p/yammi/git yammi-git
  $ cd yammi-git/src
  $ qmake-qt4
  $ make all

And you are done. Right now you should be able to run Yammi from the source tree:
  $ ./yammi

Or if you want to install it somewhere do following. This will install it to
your home directory e.g. /home/user/bin/yammi (so no root rights required):
  $ qmake-qt4
  $ make install

Then you can start it by this command:
  $ ~/bin/yammi/yammi



The directory containing the yammi executable can be moved to another location
and be startable from there.
The configuration lies in following files and directories:
  /home/user/.local/share/data/yammi/yammi
  /home/user/.config/yammi



Translations:
-------------
Currently the english and german languages should be in a good shape.
For spanish and italian I could judge about it - you have to try it.
If they are not usable please delete the translations/yammi*.qm file for your locale.
Other translations are not included.


I hope you enjoy using Yammi...
