<H3><A NAME="s2">2. Installation</A></H3>

<P>
<H3><A NAME="ss2.1">2.1 How to obtain Yammi</A>
</H3>

<P>Give it a try at 
<A HREF="yammi.sourceforge.net">The Yammi Homepage</A>
or email me at 
<A HREF="mailto:oli.noelle@web.de">oli.noelle@web.de</A><P>
<H3><A NAME="ss2.2">2.2 Requirements</A>
</H3>

<P>The program was developed under Linux with qt2.3 and kde2.2.1,
but it does not use any KDE classes (so far).
<P>So what you definitely need should be only qt 2.x and Xmms 1.2.6 or later (X Multimedia System).
<P>This version is probably the last version based on qt2.x, the next version
will require qt3.x.
<P>If you want to decode mp3s to wav files or listen to songs on a second soundcard
you need mpg123.
<P>If you want to use the ripping and encoding function performed by the script "grabAndEncode"
you need cdparanoia and (not)lame, for details have a look at the script.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="ss2.3">2.3 Compilation and installation</A>
</H3>

<P>
<P>In order to compile and install Yammi on your system, type the following in
the base directory of the Yammi distribution:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
% ./configure
% make
% make install
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>This should install the executable "yammi" and two additional scripts
("yammiGrabAndEncode" and "yammiShutdownScript") in /usr/local/bin/.
<P>
<P>Since Yammi uses 
<PRE>
autoconf
</PRE>
 you should have not trouble
compiling it.
Should you run into problems please report them to the the author at 
<A HREF="mailto:oli.noelle@web.de">oli.noelle@web.de</A><P>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="ss2.4">2.4 Deinstallation </A>
</H3>

<P>In the base directory of the yammi distribution, type
<P>% make uninstall
<P>If you are not upgrading to a new version of yammi, but want to completely
remove all files related to yammi from your harddisk,
you can also delete the directory .yammi in your home directory.
(This deletes your preferences, categories and the complete database!)
<P>
<H3><A NAME="ss2.5">2.5 Starting the first time </A>
</H3>

<P>After successful installation, you can start yammi by typing "yammi" in a shell
(if you encounter any problems or want to know what's going on it helps to have
a look at the terminal output that yammi creates on the console).
On the first start, yammi will create a directory ".yammi" in your home directory,
where it will store the song database, preferences settings and logfiles.
Before you start scanning your harddisk for songs, you should edit the preferences
(File -> Preferences) and set the paths to the location of your mp3 collection.
