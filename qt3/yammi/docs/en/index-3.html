<H3><A NAME="s3">3. Usage </A></H3>

<P>
<H3><A NAME="ss3.1">3.1 General Usage </A>
</H3>

<P>The general usage of the program should be pretty intuitive:
<P>On the left, you have a list of folders, each containing a list of songs or subfolders.
<P>On the right, you have a list of songs, with different attributes shown in different
columns.
<P>Use the left folder list to pick a selection of (or all) songs, then the right list to
pick one (or more) songs to play, edit, categorise, ...
<P>The most important actions are available in the toolbar, the others are available from
the menu or context menu (right-click on a song or a folder).
<P>
<P>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="ss3.2">3.2 Scanning harddisk</A>
</H3>

<P>The first step is to get your songs into Yammis database by having your harddisk scanned.
<P>For this to work, you should check the configuration (File->Preferences) and make sure
that the directory "base directory for scanning" is pointing to the base directory of your mp3 collection.
Also, give a path for "trash directory for deleted song files", as this directory is needed when
you want to delete songs within yammi (yammi does not delete the files, but moves them
to this directory and skips this directory when scanning for new songs).
<P>After setting the preferences, you can perform a database update (File->Update Database),
which will insert all found songs into the yammi database.
Also see "Updating Database" in "Advanced Topics".
<P>There is also a menu entry for scanning removable media (File->Scan Removable Media),
which can be used eg. to scan a CD. In contrast to scanning the harddisk,
Yammi's database won't contain path + filename information for those songs
found on scanning a removable media. Instead, these songs need to be loaded
into a swap directory to play them. Also see "Removable Media Managements" in
"Advanced Topics".
<P>
<H3><A NAME="ss3.3">3.3 Searching</A>
</H3>

<P>Type in anything into the search field, Yammi immediately shows you the nearest matches, rated with
a percentage. (You can configure the threshold for the shown matches in the preferences.)
<P>That's basically it, simple but effective, just give it a try
(e.g. horribly misspelling songs your looking for...)
Yammi looks into title, artist, album and comment for similarities.
<P>Yammi will automatically switch to the folder "Search Results" whenever you type
in anything into the search field. Ctrl-F or ESC set the focus to the search field
and clear it.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="ss3.4">3.4 Song information </A>
</H3>

<P>In the songlist there is one row per song, containing various information
about the song.
The following columns are available:
<P>(* = corresponds to id3 tag info, + = extracted from mp3 layer info)
<P>artist*
<P>title*
<P>album*
<P>length+
<P>year*
<P>track*
<P>genre*
<P>addedTo
<P>bitrate+
<P>path
<P>filename
<P>comment*
<P>last played
<P>
<P>Depending on the chosen folder, there may be additional columns. So far these are:
<P>Match (folder "Search Results")
<P>Pos (folder "Playlist" and "Categories")
<P>Played on(folder "SongsPlayed" and "History")
<P>Reason (folder "Problematic Songs")
<P>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="ss3.5">3.5 Song coloring </A>
</H3>

<P>
<P>The songs entries in the songlist are normally written in black, except:
<P>currently played song (red)
<P>song enqueued in playlist (blue)
<P>song already played in this session (green)
<P>song not available on local harddisk or swap (grey) (=> needs to be loaded before playing)
<P>song available in swap dir (dark grey) (=> song is already loaded, will be only
checked for folder "Playlist")
<P>
<H3><A NAME="ss3.6">3.6 Folder structure </A>
</H3>

<P>The following folder structure is provided automatically:
<P>
<H4>Folder "All Music" </H4>

<P>Contains all songs in the Yammi database
<P>
<H4>Folder "Playlist" </H4>

<P>Contains all songs that are still to play, plus the currently played song.
<P>This is the only folder (besides the categories) where you can move songs around
to change the order of the songs to play.
(You can't drag a song to the top, which is the currently played song.)
Please note that you can only drag songs if the folder is ordered
ascending after the first column ("Pos", this is the default when you click on
this folder)
<P>
<H4>Folder Albums (Artists, Genre) </H4>

<P>Contains a subfolder for every album (artist, genre) for which there are more than 5
songs in the database.
<P>
<H4>Folder Categories </H4>

<P>This folder contains "categories" (or "playlists") of songs,
that can be created and filled by the user.
(Adding a song to a category: right-click on song, and choose "Insert into...").
The subfolders itself can be ordered by dragging the songs to the desired
location. Please note that you can only drag songs if the folder is ordered
ascending after the first column ("Pos", this is the default when you click on
this folder)
<P>
<H4>Folder History </H4>

<P>This folder contains the history of played songs, each song shown with the
timestamp when it was played. For played songs to be logged, you need to activate
"logging of played songs" in the preferences. This folder only contains the
songs loaded from the history file at startup. Songs played in this session will
be appended to the folder "Songs Played".
<P>
<H4>Folder Songs Played </H4>

<P>Contains all songs that have been played in this session of Yammi, together with
a timestamp. When Yammi terminates, these songs will be appended to the history
file, appearing in the folder "History" the next time Yammi starts.
<P>
<H4>Folder Media </H4>

<P>Contains a subfolder for every media (eg. CD) that you prepared with Yammi.
When burning mp3 files to a CD with the help of Yammi, the program records the
location of songs to its database.
This enables you to quickly find on which media you have backup copies of songs.
In future releases, this should also enable you to play songs that are not on
your harddisk, by automatically requesting a media that contains this song.
<P>
<H4>Folder Problematic Songs </H4>

<P>This Folder contains songs that were found problematic when performing a
consistency check (eg. songs contained twice).
<P>
<H4>Folder Search Results </H4>

<P>This folder contains the result of the last search process.
<P>
<H4>Folder Unclassified </H4>

<P>This folder contains all songs that are not appearing in either
<P>- a category
<P>- the folder "Artists"
<P>- the folder "Albums"
<P>This folder can help you organizing your songs into categories.
<P>
<H4>Directory structure </H4>

<P>Mp3 files can still be organized in a directory structure according to your own needs.
Yammi keeps its own database of songs with all necessary information
(artist, title, album, filename, ...). This song databse is saved as a simple xml
file in the user's home directory under $HOME/.yammi/songdb.xml.
You should take care not to move your songfiles around from outside Yammi,
because Yammi will not find the files any more.
Yammi provides a function to move song files,
where at the same time the information in the Yammi database is updated.
Please make use of that function when you need to reorganize your songs on your
harddisk.
When you moved songs from outside Yammi, you can also perform an "Update Database",
then Yammi tries to figure out those songs that have been moved and updates the
corresponding information in its database.
<P>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="ss3.7">3.7 Song Actions </A>
</H3>

<P>Clicking on a song with the right mouse button, the context menu allows you the
following actions (most of them are available on the toolbar, too):
<P>
<H4>Play...</H4>

<P>...Enqueue - Enqueues a song to the end of Yammi's playlist.
<P>...Enqueue as next - Enqueues a song as the next song to play in Yammi's playlist.
<P>...Play immediately - First enqueues the song as the very next to play, then causes a song change, so the song
is immediately played.
<P>...Dequeue - Dequeues a song from Yammi's playlist, ie. removes all occurrences of this song
in Yammi's playlist.
<P>
<H4>Prelisten to...</H4>

<P>(only available if a second sound device is configured in the preferences)
<P>...start - Immediately starts playing the song via the second sound device, starting from the beginning.
<P>...middle - Immediately starts playing the song via the second sound device, starting in the middle.
<P>...end - Immediately starts playing the song via the second sound device, starting close to the end.
<P>
<H4>Info...</H4>

<P>Opens a dialog with info and edit possibility for the selected song(s).
The dialog shows the different fields that Yammi saves in its database.
If more than one song was selected, this enables convenient mass-editing of songs:
<P>Mass Editing
<P>For multiple selected songs the song info dialog is a little different:
<P>- time and size of all selected songs are summed up (eg. useful for checking how
many songs fit on one CD)
<P>- entries that are not exactly the same for all selected songs are shown as "!".
As long, as this is not changed, these entries are not touched.
When you change this entry, you can conveniently set that entry for all selected
songs to the new value.
<P>- entries that are exactly the same can be conveniently changed for all selected
songs by changing the value shown.
<P>
<P>
<H4>Insert into...</H4>

<P>Here you can insert one or more songs into an existing category or remove them.
The icon in front of the category name shows whether the song(s) will be added or
removed from the category. A check means that the song(s) is already contained.
Selecting a category with a check will remove the song(s) from it.
<P>
<P>
<H4>Search for similar...</H4>

<P>This allows you to quickly search for songs from the same artist (or album or title)
as the selected song. It simply gets the information you requested from the song
and performs the usual fuzzy search with it.
<P>
<H4>Advanced...</H4>

<P>
<P>Delete -
Deleting can be done in two ways:
<P>Deleting the database entry in Yammi's database (does not touch the song file).
<P>Deleting the song file, which is done by moving the song file to the trash directory.
Yammi still keeps the database entry (the song may be present on some media, and
copied to the harddisk before playing).
<P>Copy file to... - Asks for a directory and copies the mp3 file to it.
<P>Copy file as WAV to... - Asks for a directory, uses mpg123 to decode the mp3 file and copies it to the directory.
<P>Move file to... - Moves a file to another directory. The path information in Yammi's database will
be updated with the new location of that file.
<P>Check consistency - Performs a consistency check on the selected song(s).
See consistency modes.
<P>Burn to media... - assists in burning the selected songs to a media
(see "Burning files" in "Advanced Topics")
<P>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="ss3.8">3.8 Preferences</A>
</H3>

<P>
<P>You can set the preferences via the menu: File -> Preferences
<P>Most items should be self-explanatory if you read the tool tips provided
(stay over an item with mouse cursor for a while).
<P>Consistency Mode
<P>These settings determine, whether Yammi checks and modifies the id3
tags and filenames of your
mp3 collection. If both are acivated this has the following effect:
<P>If you change eg. the title of a song via Yammi's song info dialog, Yammi will
not only change the entry in its internal database, but also
the id3 tags and the filename accordingly the next time it saves its database.
Yammi uses the schema "artist - title.mp3" for naming the files,
but first tries to remove all characters that are possibly not allowed in
filenames (on linux as well as windows (vfat) file systems),
however no guarantee can be given that "strange" artist or title entries
don't cause any problems with naming the files...
Please let me know about problems concerning the naming of files, so I can fix
them.
<P>If you don't want Yammi to touch your mp3 files in any way, you should
leave these two settings disabled!
However, for easy organizing your song files I found it extremely useful
to have consistent filenames and tags at any time.
<P>See also "Checking consistency" in "Advanced topics".
<P>
<P>Group Threshold
<P>This value determines, how many items of one group must be present for a
subfolder within the folder Artist/Albums/Genre to be created. If you set this
value to 1, every artist/album/genre will appear as a subfolder, a value of 10
only will create subfolders for artists/albums/genres which contain at least 10
songs.
<P>
