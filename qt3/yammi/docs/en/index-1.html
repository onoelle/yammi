<H3><A NAME="s1">1. Introduction</A></H3>

<P>Yammi stands for "Yet Another Music Manager I..." and is a tool to manage your mp3 collection.
It is centered around an intuitive graphical user interface and a song database,
which allows very convenient and fast access to any mp3 songs.
For playing songs the program serves as a front-end for XMMS
(
<A HREF="http://www.xmms.org">X MultiMedia System</A>).
So far, Yammi only supports Xmms and the mp3 format.
<P>Yammi enables you to
<P>- conveniently search for songs (fuzzy search)
<P>- organize your songs into playlists/categories
<P>- keep statistics (when/how many times was song x played?)
<P>- easily keep your song info, id3 tags and filenames consistent
<P>- burn your song collection on CDs
<P>- act as a jukebox, loading song files on demand from removable media
<P>- prelisten to songs on headphone to DJ your own party (needs a second sound device)
<P>- invoke command-line tools such as mp3burn or cdlabelgen to burn CDs or generate labels using the
information from the song database
<P>
<P>The feature that distinguishes this tool from others is probably the extremely powerful fuzzy (tolerant)
search function, that is still as intuitive and easy as it can get:
Type in anything that you are looking for (eg. artist, title, album, comment) and within a second Yammi
will provide a list of "best matches", using a clever fuzzy search algorithm.
Not knowing the exact spelling of titles or artists is not a problem any more, as Yammi will find them
anyway - even if you are horribly misspelling them in the search.
This fuzzy search works just as you would expect it, even with a few thousand songs in the database.
<P>
<P>With the help of Yammi you will never again encounter the pain of digging through your directory structures
to find a particular song. Yammi also offers to create playlists/categories of songs, and sort songs after
just every available information, enabling you to sort your songs on
title, artist, length, most recently added songs, most recently played, bitrate, filename, comment...
<P>
<P>Yammi does as an excellent job on a party. In connection with Xmms'
<A HREF="http://www.netcologne.de/~nc-eisenlpe2/xmms-crossfade/">crossfading plugin</A>
(
<A HREF="http://volnorm.sourceforge.net/">volume normalization</A> might be useful, too)
and a second sound card (to listen to songs on a headphone) it almost replaces the DJ,
and is still extremely easy to use allowing even people with no computer experience to DJ the party.
<P>
<P>Yammi does also a good job in replacing your CD-player. In connection with a infrared receiver and
<A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/lirc/">LIRC</A> its basic functions can be accessed
with a remote control, even enabling you to turn off your computer via remote control
(or let it play five more songs before shutting down).
<P>
<P>
<P>Although I tried my best, I can take no liability that my program
is not causing any damage to your mp3 collection or anything else...
<P>

<H3><A NAME="ss1.1">1.1 Changes</A>
</H3>

<P>For changes, see the file CHANGELOG included in the distribution.
Note that Yammi now requires Xmms 1.2.6 or later!
