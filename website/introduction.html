Make music management on your computer as <b>easy and efficient</b> as it <i>should be</i>.

<big>metric</big><BR/>

How do we define <b><i>easy and efficient</i></b>?<BR/><BR/>

What about measuring the time and ease of use for the following use case:<BR/>

<ol>
<LI><strong>search for a song "It's Build" by "Hausmartins"</strong><BR/>
    (or similar, because you can't remember the exact spelling...)</LI>
<LI><strong>find out that there is a song "Build" by "The Housemartins"</strong><BR/>
    (oh right, that was the correct name...)</LI>
<LI><strong>play this song after the currently playing song has finished</strong><BR/>
    (you don't want to interrupt the lovely song you're listening to right now...)</LI>
<LI><strong>find all songs on the same album as this song</strong><BR />
    (because you want to listen to all of them now...)</LI>
<LI><strong>and finally burn an audio CD with that album</strong><BR/>
    (because your girl friend likes that album, but she hates computers...)</LI>
</ol>
</p>

<p>

<big>solution</big><BR/>
Let's see how we do this with Yammi:

<p>
<strong>Step 1: search for the song</strong><BR/>
<img src="pics/shot1.png" align="right" border="0" />
Press "ESC" from anywhere in Yammi to clear the search field and set the focus to it.<BR/>
Type "It's build Hausmartins"<BR/>
=> 3-5 seconds (depending on how fast you type)
</p>

<p>
<strong>Step 2: find the song</strong><BR/>
Look at the best matches list that Yammi automatically provides<BR/>

=> 1-2 seconds (depending on how fast you look, the search takes much less than a second)
</p>

<p><strong>Step 3: play as next song</strong><BR/>
Choose "Play/Enqueue" -> "Enqueue as next" from the song context menu
or the corresponding keyboard shortcut.<BR/>

=> 1-3 seconds

</p>

<p><strong>Step 4: find all songs on the same album</strong><BR/>
Choose "Go to folder" -> "album" from the song context menu<BR/>

=> 3 seconds
</p>

<p><strong>Step 5: burn an audio CD with that album</strong>
Choose "Content" -> "Plugins" -> "Burn to audio CD" from the folder context menu.<BR/>
Start burning process in K3B (which starts up with the desired songs added automatically).<BR/>

=> 7 seconds

</p>


<p><strong>Results</strong><BR/>
<i>Fast?</i> Well, less than 30 seconds...<BR/>
<i>Easy?</i> I think so... (better watch your girlfriend...)<BR/>
<strong>...but?</strong> Of course there are other tasks in managing a music collection,
but there's also more behind Yammi... see <a href="features.html">Yammi's features</a>.

<big>conclusion</big><BR/>
Think about your music management.<BR/>
Do you know exactly which songs you have? ...and which not? And how they are spelled?<BR/>
How long does it take <i>you</i> to lookup a song and play it?<BR/>
Ever found yourself digging through your harddisk for a particular song?<BR/>
<BR/>
In other words: <strong>Satisfied with your current music organization?</strong><BR/>
...well, then keep it! Never change a running system!<BR/>
<BR/>
<strong>Not satisfied?</strong> It's not as easy as it <i>should be</i>?<BR/>

...well, take a closer look at <a href="features.html">Yammi's features</a>!<BR/>
Chances are you don't want to miss Yammi's fuzzy search in the future any more...

<big>competition</big><BR/>
There are other music managers for linux out there, some of them quite powerful.
The following list is definitely not complete, nor have I tried all of them extensively myself.
Just one tip: amarok looks very promising and has a lot of momentum right now...
