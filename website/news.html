<big>29.03.2007 - Yammi development stopped...</big>
<p>
Due to the lack of time to continue my work on Yammi I have to announce that development of Yammi has stopped (not without releasing a little bugfix version, see the entry below).<BR/><BR/>

Though I'm still missing my favourite feature of Yammi (fast and simple fuzzy search) in <a href="http://amarok.kde.org">Amarok</a>, I can easily recommend those of you who are still using Yammi, but are missing essential features or experiencing problems, to switch to Amarok...<BR/><BR/>

Thanks for all the feedback and all contributions to this project, I learned a lot from it...<BR/><BR/>

...and if I find some time, I might spend it on integrating a decent fuzzy search into Amarok (there's a <a href="http://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=116334">feature request</a> for it, and if you miss it too, you can vote for it).

<big>29.03.2007 - Version 1.2.3 released</big>
<p>
As I stopped development of Yammi I did not want to leave behind a version that does not even compile on recent gcc versions (4.0 and later), so here is a minimal bugfix version with just two bugs fixed:
<ul>
<LI>fixed: incorrect qualifier in "fuzzsrch.h" causing compilation problems with newer versions of gcc (4.0 and above)</LI>
<LI>fixed: Bug 1436536: bug in consistency check (not detecting two songs with identical primary keys)</LI>
</ul>

<big>03.11.2005 - Article about Yammi in Linux Magazine</big>
<p>
The <a href="http://www.linux-magazine.com/">Linux Magazine</a> features an <a href="http://www.linux-magazine.com/issue/61/KTools_Yammi.pdf">article about Yammi</a> in its <a href="http://www.linux-magazine.com/issue/61">December 2005 Issue (No. 61)</a>. The closing paragraph concludes: <em>"Yammi keeps the promise of being simple
and compact. [...] Yammi is good choice for those who are put off by the feature overkill that databases such as Amarok [7] give but still need more than just a simple media player."
</em>

<big>31.07.2005 - Version 1.2.2 released</big>
<p>
Only 24 hours later, but as two important bugs slipped into version 1.2.1: Here comes version 1.2.2 fixing these two bugs (missing icons and translation files in tarball, not replacing umlaute when creating filenames).<BR/>

<big>18.01.2005 - Version 1.2-rc2 released</big>
<p>
The long-awaited integration of 
<a href="http://developer.kde.org/~wheeler/taglib.html">Scott Wheeler's taglib</a>
made me release another release candidate.
Some more bugfixes and little improvements make Yammi more usable, for
a detailed list see the <a href="CHANGELOG.html">CHANGELOG</a>.
One point should be mentioned for upgraders:
The consistency mode settings have been changed, see the tooltips in the settings
or the handbook for details.

<big>14.09.2004 - Version 1.2-beta released</big>
<p>
After a rather long time in which I did my best to make Yammi a proper KDE application
and further enhance its usability and stability, the first beta release is available.
</p>
<p>
There are some minor issues left,
but this version should be already enough stable and usable for a broader community.
As always, any feedback is highly appreciated.
