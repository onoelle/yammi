<b>XMMS crashes once in a while (causing Yammi to hang)</b><br>
There seems to be a bug in XMMS, causing it to crash immediately after a song change.
The symptoms are the following: Although XMMS continues to play the current song to the end, it freezes which
causes Yammi to freeze, too. You eventually have to kill XMMS...<br>

This bug is reported to the XMMS bug database (bug# 855), but still seems to be present in version 1.2.8.
If you experience this bug, please vote for it on http://bugs.xmms.org, maybe it gets attention then...
