<h1>Get involved in Yammi development...</h1>

<p>
Are you interested in making Yammi better?
</p>

<p>
Even if you are not a programmer, there are a lot of things where you could help the project:

<ul>
<li>web design: if you would like to improve the homepage of yammi 
(or create a completely new one): go for it!</li>
<li>graphics: new icons for the application, graphics for the website, ...</li>
<li>translations: the KDE translation scheme makes it easy to translate Yammi 
into your favourite language, see the <a href="translation.html">Translation page</a> for details</li>
<li>documentation: the handbook could need some update and polishing...</li>
<li>coding: see the TODO file (<a href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/yammi/kyammi/TODO?rev=HEAD">current version in CVS</a>), there are
more than enough features to add and bugs to fix...</li>
<li>creating rpms for various distributions</li>
</ul>

Please contact the
<a href="mailto:yammi-developer_AT_lists.sourceforge.net">yammi-developer mailing list</a>
if you would like to contribute, any help is appreciated!
