<h1>Yammi Features</h1>

</li>
<li>organize songs into playlists/categories</li>
<li>automatic folder structure (by artist/album/genre/year/history)</li>
<li>easy navigation between folders</li>
<li>automatic statistic keeping (when/how many times was a song played?)</li>
<li>powerful consistency checks to keep your song database consistent</li>
<li>organize names and location of song files by enforcing a configurable directory/filename pattern (eg. /music/{artist}/{album}/{trackNr} {artist}-{title}.{suffix})</li>

<h3>Yammi at parties</h3>
<p>
Yammi does an excellent job at a party, pulling double-duty as the
DJ and main attraction for any other geeks in the room.
Using crossfading between tracks (eg. with the
<a target="_parent" href="http://www.eisenlohr.org/xmms-crossfade/index.html">XMMS crossfading plugin</a>)
and a second sound card to prelisten to songs,
the DJ job never has been easier, even suited for people with little computer experience.
