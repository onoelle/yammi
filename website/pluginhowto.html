<h1>Plugin concept of Yammi</h1>

Yammi's plugin concept allows executing arbitrary programs for a selection of songs,
passing the information from Yammi's database about the selected songs
(eg. filename, artist, length, ...) to the programs as command line parameters.

<h3>Plugin modes</h3>
There are two plugin modes existing: single or group mode.<BR/>
In <b>single mode</b>, the configured program is invoked for each selected song.
A typical usage for single mode could be to copy the selection of songs to
another location, ie. invoke the copy command for each song.<BR/>
In <b>group mode</b>, the information for all selected songs is gathered into a list,
and the configured program is invoked once for the selection and can use the list
as input parameter. A typical usage would be to create a CD label, first gathering
the list of songs, then invoke once the program to actually create the label.<BR/>

<h2>Example for single mode</h2>
Let's assume you have a mp3 player and conveniently want to copy a selection of songs
from within Yammi to your player. Let's assume that your mp3 player is mounted on
/media/player.

<ul>
<li>For <b>plugin mode</b> we choose "single mode" and leave the field <b>custom list</b>, which only
applies to group mode, empty.</li>
<li>For <b>menu entry</b> we choose a descriptive name like "copy to mp3 player"</li>
<li>For <b>command</b> we choose a copy command with the appropriate placeholders, eg:
cp "{absoluteFilename}" "/media/player/{index}_{filename}". This example will copy
the selected files to the directory /media/player (you have to make sure that the
player is mounted before executing the plugin), prefixing the filenames of the songs
with their index within the selection of songs. Instead of {filename} you could also
choose a naming pattern like {artist}/{artist} - {title}, if you need the files to 
have a certain directory structure and/or naming convention at the target location.</li>

</ul>


<h2>Example for group mode</h2>
Let's assume you just burned a selection of songs to CD and would like to create
a CD label for that selection. We use a command line tool called <a href="http://www.aczone.com/tools/cdinsert/">cdlabelgen</a>,
which does a good job in creating CD labels from command line parameters. Now we only have to feed the appropriate info from Yammi to this program as the appropriate input parameters.

<ul>
<li>For <b>plugin mode</b> we choose "group mode".</li>
<li>In <b>custom list</b> we have to specify how one entry in our list should look like. We choose the following line: "{index}. {artist} - {title} ({length})%" to create entries like "1. Sylver - Angel (2:16)" (notice the trailing "%" which cdlabelgen requires as separator between entries"</li>
<li>For <b>menu entry</b> we choose a descriptive name like "create CD label"</li>
<li>For <b>command</b> we choose "cdlabelgen -c "{inputString:title}" -s "{inputString:subtitle}" -b -w -i "{customList}" > {fileDialog}". This first pops up two input dialogs asking the user for a title and subtitle, and then creates a CD label using the custom list as input, which finally gets written to a file that the user has to select. (You could also directly invoke kghostview on the created file to view it.)</li>

</ul>
