<h1>Help wanted for Yammi!</h1>

There are a few issues I could need some help on...<br>
...so if you know a bit about programming under linux (especially autoconf/automake/packaging) read on...
<br>
...and let <a HREF="mailto:oli.noelle_AT_web.de" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='Send me an E-mail' ;return true">me</a>
know if you could help me out!
<br>
(Yes, I am totally lost if it comes to makefiles and configure scripts...)


<h3>cannot compute sizeof (int)</h3>
I had some people experiencing this problem...any ideas? (seems as if some path are not set correctly)

<h3>cannot find QT</h3>
I experienced this problem myself a couple of times... same reason as for the problem before? Missing path?
(when this happens, always complains about "no libcrypt found" also)<br>
Someone reported the following line in configure script was wrong and needed to be commented out:<br>
<pre>
ac_qt_libraries="NO"
</pre>
<p>
What causes this line to be created??? Any ideas???</p>

<h3>error on installing: directory /usr/local/bin not existing</h3>
That path is probably hardcoded into my makefiles...?

Where do you normally install/what variable would you use to install into the correct directory?

<br>
Where do you put documentation? I've got a handbook for Yammi, but I can't assume that /opt/kde3/share
or similar exists, can I?

<h3>missing seperator</h3>
Some users reported the following problem when compiling (makefile screwed?): any ideas what to do?
<pre>
~/yammi-0.7> make
make  all-recursive
make[1]: Entering directory `/home/thomas/yammi-0.7'
Making all in yammi
make[2]: Entering directory `/home/thomas/yammi-0.7/yammi'
Makefile:423: *** missing separator.  Stop.
make[2]: Leaving directory `/home/thomas/yammi-0.7/yammi'
make[1]: *** [all-recursive] Error 1
make[1]: Leaving directory `/home/thomas/yammi-0.7'
make: *** [all-recursive-am] Error 2
</pre>

<h3>conditional compiling</h3>
To disable linking against certain libraries (such as libkdecore for Noatun support)
I inserted the following lines into my "configure.in": <br>
<pre>
AC_ARG_ENABLE(noatun,
[  --disable-noatun           disable support for noatun (don't use kdelibs)], enable_noatun=no, enable_noatun=yes)
AC_MSG_CHECKING(for noatun support)
if test "x$enable_noatun" = xyes; then
    LIBS="-lkdecore $LIBS"
    AC_DEFINE(ENABLE_NOATUN)
    AC_MSG_RESULT(yes)
else
    echo "*** noatun support disabled ***"
    AC_MSG_RESULT(no)
fi
</pre>
The following line is in acconfig.h:
<pre>
#undef ENABLE_NOATUN
</pre>
The rationale is that the configure switch --disable-noatun should make Yammi compile withou linking against
kdelibcore.<br>
Is this the correct way? Anything else I should take care of?

<h3>conditional compiling 2</h3>
For disabling eg. XMMS support, I put #ifdef around the complete .h and .cpp file.<br>
But then compiler complains about syntax errors in the .moc files:<br>
<pre>
xmmsplayer.moc.cpp:22: syntax error before `::' <br>
</pre>
How can I disable the compiling of a complete class???


<h3>multiple configure check</h3>
When running make, the package first seems to execute "./configure" again, even if "./configure" was run before.

Where is this setting? Can I disable it?

<h3>dependencies</h3>
How can I exactly find out, which are the dependencies of Yammi?
<br>
I know, that it depends on ogg/vorbis libraries...but on which ones exactly?
<br>
From which packages do I need the devel-versions installed?
<br>
Can I reduce the dependencies (by linking statically to some libs)?
